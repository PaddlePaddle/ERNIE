Everything else is OK. Although it's not up to the 5-star standard, it&apos;s still very clean and spacious. The most intolerable buffet seafood dinner in the resort is surrounded by flies. The food is full of flies, it costs a lot of money, and there&apos;s a lot of fire,	1
Both hardware and software are very disappointing for a hotel.After reading the comments of friends in front, I didn&apos;t want to stay in this Tuen River Ramada, but I had to come because it was not easy to book rooms in the peak tourist season.Check in one night to leave, I suggest friends not to try.The lobby of the shop is narrow.The room area is not small, but the furniture is few and old, feeling cold and empty.The carpet is dirty and the decoration is dark and old.The bathroom is small, the color of bath ware is dirty, and the towel is sloppy.There are very few TV programs.The service consciousness is very poor. The front desk and the assistant manager are arrogant, arrogant and argumentative.The operator is like a novice, who can&apos;t answer the question.Only the doorman took the initiative to take the luggage for the customer, showing his dedication.Breakfast feels like a guest house.There has always been a lack of training in the hotel, and the staff have no idea of respecting customers.I don&apos;t know who operates the brand management of Ramada in China.It&apos;s not up to four stars at all. I heard that it&apos;s a bit worse than Samsung&apos;s Xinrong building.Also hope that Ctrip can strengthen research and provide more accurate information for customers.	0
Liu Lin is strong. As the doctor said in the article, in the hospital, it can best reflect whether a person is really strong.Liu Lin belongs to the kind of strong people, strong into her a protective color.However, her strong and distressing, people want to close to her but not close.I admire the strong of Liu Lin in the article, because to be a strong woman like her, we really need to disguise our tears and loneliness.Although the girls are brave now.But there are few who want to be independent and strong.This is a good book, a good book that people will think deeply after reading.	1
"All the girls in Ming Xiaoxi&apos;s books have many friends, especially intimate friends.Feelings are like ""whirlwind girl"" in the grass and Xiaoying, there will be no jealousy and other negative emotions, mutual support, mutual encouragement, grow up together, warm and touching."	1
Half of the time, a few pages are blank. A good book is broken in the middle. I want to return it, but I have made notes on it	0
The location of the hotel is good, the park is out, the room is small, breakfast is OK	1
"The meal is average, and the price is a little more expensive than usual. Please pay attention when signing the bill because it has no details. It will only write ""zero order meal"" and then a total amount of ""such as"" zero order meal - 1032.00 ""). If it is a group transfer, please pay attention to the phenomenon of overcharging, and the cycle is very long. It may take one month to reconcile the account. (please distinguish between the sales and your reconciliation, not finance)"	0
The content is general; the printing is very bad, I don&apos;t know what kind of garbage paper and ink to use, it&apos;s stinky, it&apos;s not close at all	0
The third time I stayed in the hotel, I had good experience before, so I always chose the hotel, but this time I couldn&apos;t swipe my card. I felt that it was the hotel&apos;s intention to save the service charge. Fortunately, there was a balance in cash, otherwise it would be very troublesome and I didn&apos;t want to stay next time.	0
The executive room I ordered is very small and the building is relatively old. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s different from the ordinary room except that I can surf the Internet.The hotel itself is small.	0
The CD-ROM drive is amazing for the sound of a few discs, but most discs are very light. Maybe there is something wrong with those discs	0
When I saw the book, I first felt that the content was messy. At the beginning, there were several pages of flattering words, and then there were dozens of pages of nonsense. Then I would talk about this and that, and I would rewrite the words in each paragraph according to a title, wasting paper (if I want to emphasize, I can use bold printing), artificially increasing the length, the number of pages, and improving the accuracyPrice.The content is not practical, I feel cheated.	0
On the whole, very satisfied.It&apos;s a little far from the city center. The rooms are clean and tidy.I live in a big bed room with a smaller area.The service was very good. I washed my underwear free of charge and gave fruit (2 bananas and 2 apples) every day. The waiter was very polite.The disadvantage is that breakfast is not rich, and the price of the restaurant on the first floor is too high.	1
4When I went back to Qingdao in January, I took my friends to play. The hotel was my choice. The room was clean and tidy, but the toilet facilities were too simple. There was a small refrigerator in the room. I was considerate. If the toilet facilities were better, it would be better!The attitude of the service staff was very good. We Qingdao people didn&apos;t lose face. We were on call.	1
The location of the hotel is not bad, and the transportation is convenient.But the hotel appearance, room facilities are relatively old.	0
Through this book, I can see the personal growth process of Mr. Yu Minhong, and understand that in fact, everyone has different experiences, and will encounter different situations in different periods and stages. The key to crossing the past is his own mentality. A positive mentality is very helpful for a person&apos;s whole life!This book also talks about the employment problems of college students. Many of the problems are encountered by many college students now. It is not only helpful for college students, but also enlightening for our young people. It is a great book!!	1
It&apos;s really simple. I suggest you read it carefully. There will be a different reception!	1
The sound insulation of the room is really poor. There is Mermaid water next door. I didn&apos;t sleep well all night!House prices are not low, only cheaper than Huayang 50 yuan!	0
I ordered the goods three weeks ago. The delivery company delivered the goods on Saturday. I wasn&apos;t in the company. They said they would deliver the goods again in three days. As a result, they treated it as a return. It delayed my time and made me evaluate. I evaluated a P. I was so angry!No more books in Dangdang	0
It&apos;s very nice. It&apos;s very attractive.It&apos;s also very functional and comfortable to use.The price is 200 less than that of Gome, because there is no free mouse and original bag.	1
LD and I stayed a total of 7 days and 6 nights, with 2 chocolates each day. The breakfast in the hotel was very good.The waiter is very friendly. As long as you go out, the room will be cleaned when you come back.No matter how many times you go out, this is very good and responsible!The bed is very big, the pillow is also very big, very comfortable!Overall, I feel good!There is no dissatisfaction!	1
It&apos;s very cost-effective. If you don&apos;t play games often, you can try it. I bought a Lenovo one for my colleagues in January. The configuration is basically the same. It cost 4500.	1
The partition is unreasonable. It has to be re partitioned. There is no drive disk. The logistics service is not in place. The doorman signed it on behalf of us, and there is no inspection.	0
I bought this notebook and wrote vista home advanced version at home. As a result, I got the basic version,	0
The attitude of the hotel staff is extremely bad.Especially the front desk.The restaurant didn&apos;t receive guests.The most indignant thing is that I hung up before I finished.The best advice is not to go, otherwise you will be angry, the traffic is inconvenient, and the surrounding environment is complex.	0
I bought this book, the binding is OK, there is no color insert, the text of the book is a little empty, in a word, in so many similar books, this price is not worth buying.	0
I have stayed three times before, and the room, breakfast and service are very good, so I checked in again this time. Unexpectedly, the room (the ninth floor) is very poor. It should be the old decoration. It&apos;s not as good as the crape myrtle Hotel on the opposite side. It&apos;s a big difference from the previous room. When you book, you should pay attention to the floor selection. The standard of buffet breakfast is not as good as before, and you will never live again	0
The home version of Vista system is not as good as the flagship version or XP Professional version.When changing XP, I had a headache for driving.If you want to change XP, prepare the driver in advance.	0
"The service support for users to install the system and driver is not good. There are no relevant installation instructions on the random data and official website, so users have to explore, find and download by themselves. There are ""hidden doors"" in the installation process, such as BIOS settings, HDMI installation, etc. it is easy to cause people who do not know how to install the full driver"	0
It&apos;s a lap bigger than my friend&apos;s ideapad s 10, but considering that the keyboard is relatively large and the battery time is long, it&apos;s acceptable, but the built-in Linux is too difficult to use, it&apos;s not convenient to enter the BIOS, it takes a lot of effort to replace XP.	0
The service was average, the room was a bit too bad, the things inside were too old, mom&apos;s, and so expensive. Four stars couldn&apos;t reach it. The next day, I finally couldn&apos;t help but change to a hotel	0
At present, it seems that the cost performance is the highest, the quality is also very good, and the keyboard is easy to press.Now, the goods you pick up are completely new. You can install the system directly when you start the machine.The $200 game is also fun.	1
The hotel is very good, the service staff are very good, quite polite.It&apos;s clean, quiet and convenient for transportation.The disadvantage is that check-out is too slow. It takes me half an hour	1
It&apos;s a very simple story, but it contains the rough life of the protagonist. Living is suffering, so I have to admire the toughness of life	0
It&apos;s more important than you think. It&apos;s not suitable for girls to carry. ASUS official website doesn&apos;t have this XP driver. You need to find it yourself	0
After listening to the introduction of my classmates, I bought this book. After reading it, I really benefited a lot.There are many shocking words in the article, challenging the traditional ideas, but making unique achievements. The old man&apos;s interpretation of many problems is a new way, digging the cultural connotation from the perspective of human nature, and thinking about his time, I really admire him.After reading this book, I have a good idea of the history of Chinese culture. For those who are not willing to spend a lot of effort on the whole book, but are interested in cultural history, it is worth collecting.Because the book is not pure vernacular, but also mixed with ancient Chinese, so we need to taste it carefully and slowly. My classmates and I have made an appointment to study this book for a lifetime.	1
The location of the hotel is not far from the center of the city, so the traffic is very convenient. The decoration of the lobby is European style. Although the space is not as big as some hotels, it is very warm.In the evening, there are professional performers performing in the lobby. At the time of check-in, a team just arrived at the hotel, and the guests sang along with the performance. I feel very atmosphere and like the feeling of this hotel.The room is also very spacious and the service staff are very friendly and polite. It&apos;s a well managed hotel.	1
Dangdang&apos;s online name does not match the reality, and the order has not been delivered for many days. If you ask customer service, you will only push back and ask the user to place an order again.Such service can&apos;t keep customers.It&apos;s better to go to other websites to buy books.	0
I have finished reading two books for my son. The book is a good one, but I find that bilingualism is very bad. When the child is interested in the story, he will definitely choose to read Chinese. He has lost the significance of improving his English reading ability.	1
This way of memorizing words is only suitable for some people.It&apos;s not for everyone, including me.So don&apos;t rush on, just like me, ha ha!	0
Good location, trains, subways, airport buses, cars are very convenient.It&apos;s very close to Henderson mall. You can go shopping and have a good time.The service was OK.	1
If you hate him / her, let him / her stay in Ningxia international hotel	0
"The author is regarded as ""the miracle angel of love"", which is true.Many people think that getting along with children must be full of happiness, but they don&apos;t know a responsibility to make this kind of happiness sometimes doesn&apos;t necessarily appear in the way of smile.The author really reflects the reality of getting along with her children. Although she is reading her ""story"", she feels that she is with her heart.In the same way, I am very glad that I am engaged in a job of living with children, which makes me have a wonderful life."	1
"The content of this picture book is very good. It&apos;s more suitable for parents and children to read.After borrowing it from the children&apos;s library, my son liked it very much and was not willing to pay it back.Just buy it from Dangdang and read it again.Every time I read this book, I feel mother and son&apos;s emotion sublimation, and I am infected by the strong family affection in the book.You can read the book in another way.When I was at home with my children, we used exaggerated body language to express the love way of little rabbit when we were reading books, which was more profound, more unforgettable and more like.I think this book will always be a classic picture book of our family.In addition, the original ""runaway rabbit"" is perfect enough."	1
I ordered a book, which was very good, but when I read it, I found that one page was missing. Later I applied for a replacement, but Dangdang didn&apos;t care about me.So I suggest you not to shop in Dangdang.I&apos;m done. Thank you.	0
The cost performance is relatively high, the configuration is also relatively balanced, watching movies and playing ordinary games are relatively smooth.It&apos;s very affordable.At this price: dual core processor, 3470, 250g hard disk.It&apos;s already very good.I added two Kingston 2g-800, no compatibility problem.	1
Heavier, I know, it&apos;s not her fault...You can&apos;t have both fish and bear&apos;s paw, but people are greedy	0
"It gives people a positive feeling at first. Later, as more and more complicated things happen, they feel very sad... There is a feeling of struggling like that, paying like that, and finally being zero. Maybe life is like this.I&apos;ve talked a lot about the ""hidden rules"" of the workplace, but it&apos;s a novel after all, and it&apos;s an idol drama style novel. A heroine always meets two excellent male protagonists at the same time or before or after... However, there are still many things to learn, which are worth reading"	1
The expectation before check-in is still very high, but I feel quite disappointed after arriving. There is still a certain gap between this value and the economy hotels with the price of less than 200 yuan, such as seven star hotel and home hotel. The evaluation of colleagues who went there is not high. I regret that I didn&apos;t ask for any service. It&apos;s not clear that the check-out speed is OK	0
The room is newly decorated with light colors. It feels very warm and spacious. The layout is reasonable. The cloth used in the hotel is very exquisite. It feels thick and soft in the hand. The service is considerate, especially the clothes I bring on business trip. The waiter can consider the actual needs of the guests and increase the hanger at any time. The food in the hotel is special and I have been to different floors,Although the hotel is excellent in details, if it is improved in some places, it can compete with the local four-star and five-star hotels. For example, the toilet can be hung with a small hook	1
It&apos;s far away from Mount Tai. The actual environment doesn&apos;t match the price. It has beautiful appearance, old and shabby interior and poor sound insulation	0
"It was good to read the introduction of this book, so I bought a set for my child. I originally hoped that the child would become more imaginative and brave after reading it. But after I told the child ""I can beat the monster"", the child became timid from being brave. He didn&apos;t dare to be in the room at night. He had to be accompanied by his father or mother to be in the roomHe took it from his bedroom to another room and lied to him that he would not be so timid after throwing it away."	0
Part of the label on the box was cut off, and a label at the bottom of the notebook was removed without giving a description	0
I bought this by accident. I didn&apos;t expect my daughter to like it so much. I hung it on the wall from the living room to the corridor. When she saw it, she kept laughing and clapping her hands. She was very excited, especially the little rabbit, the little girl and the little tree. She just loved it.Put her on the study floor to play, she looked up to see hanging pictures, will always smile, and then will look up, really amazing, so I recommended to a few friends of the neighbor, they also reflected that their children like, there is always a will make your children laugh, as long as you keep trying to flip these pictures.	1
1: USB, network port, power port are all on the left, not used to.2: Power adapter noise is too big, hot 3: did not send the mouse	0
The hotel is far away from Jiangmen market center. It costs 25 yuan to take a taxi alone!The service of Rhine restaurant in the hotel is very poor: the drinking water has a peculiar smell, and two of the three dishes ordered claim to have no ingredients (fresh shrimp and scallop platter: the waitress says that the scallop is not fresh and dare not serve it; &apos;tomato fried beef&apos;: the waitress says that the beef is not fresh, but the raw fried beef rice and steak have it), so the customer has to order other expensive dishes.What this beef is not that beef? It&apos;s a lie!And the waitress&apos;s attitude is absolutely not flattering, when the cancellation action is faster than us, we have to look at the face!Guest room: one of the quilts has a hole in the front and a hole in the back with a stain!The hot water kettle has broken down and can&apos;t boil normally.At the beginning, there was no hot water in the bathroom. After a period of renovation, the workers finally supplied it, but the water was rusty yellow. Let&apos;s let it go for a long time before we dare to take a bath!Another chilling thing!Sleep at night and mosquito harassment! Why do four-star hotels open in 2005 have such a phenomenon??Originally, we were going to have a rest. Unexpectedly, we got angry!	0
The design is square, the keyboard is very easy to use, is a business this, good heat dissipation, continuous use for 5 hours, the fan does not beep.Good cost performance, 512 video memory, I do flash design no problem.	1
This book is mainly about digital integrated circuits.I borrowed it from the library before and thought it was very good, so I bought one.One of the great advantages of this book is that it is relatively easy to read. Even people with physics background like me can understand most of the contents of the book.As long as you have studied the physics of semiconductor devices and understood the basis of Boolean algebra, you can understand the contents of the book thoroughly.However, it should be pointed out that the mathematical description of the I-V characteristics of MOSFET in this book is different from the formula learned in the general classroom, and it seems not used to it at first.	1
The sound of heat dissipation is a little loud.It&apos;s too troublesome to install XP. After two days of installation, I read countless posts on the Internet, made a lot of efforts, and finally failed.	0
Maybe I&apos;m too unlucky to start the original system of the new version. Fortunately, the customer service is very good. The original recovery disk was sent to me by express on the same day. Now it&apos;s in normal use. I hope it won&apos;t happen again in the future	0
The front desk of the hotel is very considerate, fast and efficient, with good service attitude and five-star standard!Praise me here!	1
"I finished reading the whole book in about a week. When I first read it, I had the idea of abandoning it, but since I bought it, I still finished it.On the whole, it&apos;s not bad. The boldness of being a woman&apos;s leader and the strength of being a child are all to the ground.The content of the article is a flashback technique, but it always makes me feel that men and women love each other a little bit reluctantly.It&apos;s not as good-looking as recommended.However, the description of the reality in the article is OK. The early married people&apos;s complaints about the society and the envy of the friends around them are very real.It&apos;s a successful article, but I think it&apos;s ""full"" after reading it once. I don&apos;t want to read it again."	1
When installing memory, I have to admire IBM employees. How hard did you screw those two screws	0
I drove there on the 11th.Under the enthusiastic guidance of the hotel operator, it was easier to find it.However, after entering the room, everything has changed: the room is only on the first floor, the TV remote control is not available, the air conditioning is not available all day, the phone can&apos;t be picked up, the service lady can&apos;t know what to ask, the travel consultation is empty, and it&apos;s the same after three days and two nights.However, the food in the hotel restaurant seems to be better than that in the local restaurant outside, but the priceNo comment!Never go again next time!	0
In the book of aggressive, there is an error in the text and the back of the book. Please give the reader a reasonable explanation and correct it!This is also the business reputation problem!	0
After reading the bandit&apos;s book in one day, I feel as touching and romantic as before. I can&apos;t help but imagine that I can meet such a hero and sigh about the tragic fate of the heroine. However, I think that this novel is far away from reality. The heroine&apos;s life is luxurious and full of erosive atmosphere, and Cinderella is sufferingTo the prince so irrational love, the reality of slightly mature and rational people will not be so, life or life, and this book is just a modern fairy tale.	1
The pattern of the room is a failure in geomantic omen. The toilet is blocked. It&apos;s a helpless night!!!	0
It has been checked in for many times. The scenery outside the window of room 04 is still so beautiful, and shopping in the supermarket opposite is also very convenient.	1
The facilities are very good; the surrounding environment is very good, close to the golden beach; the recommended sea view room is insufficient: relatively partial; eating without convenience; the cost performance of the restaurant in the hotel is too poor.The price is too expensive and the taste is not good;	1
The content is simple and easy to understand, the color is soft, teach the baby in daily life should be polite, behavior, etc	0
Breakfast is terrible, but the four stars in this kind of place are almost like this	0
The environment is very dirty and unclean. It seems that the sheets have not been changed for a long time. They are in a dilapidated state. Hotel feedback June 29, 2008: Thank you for your valuable advice. Our facilities and equipment have been completely replaced. Welcome to stay next time!	0
I&apos;m always worried about the muddle headed life, and I&apos;m always at a loss because I don&apos;t have enough time. Although time management is some old-fashioned techniques, it&apos;s really effective to stick to it. Whenever I come home from work, I will feel a sense of satisfaction, a kind of inner enrichment and excitement.The book was finished when I bought it, and in the process of implementation, I reviewed the old and learned the new.If you really don&apos;t know how to arrange your time, it&apos;s good to buy one.At least from the heart, you will have the desire to work and study.Because time doesn&apos;t stop for anything.	1
Under the same configuration, it&apos;s much more expensive than others. Big brands need advertising expenses!The CD-ROM is a bit sunken, and it&apos;s a bit troublesome to add memory, but there are many flaws!	0
Although the design of horizontal lines has a sense of wholeness, it seems a little jumping, especially when it is opened, the keyboard area is also full of horizontal lines, which makes it messy	0
Light, elegant appearance, introverted, in addition to memory, other configuration is also good, fortunately, sent a 1G memory module. Good heat dissipation, low noise, running almost can not hear sound. Machine stability is also good	1
Advantages: good book, is the screen dot shortage: good book, is the screen dot	0
"It&apos;s a good hotel. If I don&apos;t open ""please don&apos;t disturb"" twice, the hotel attendant knocked on the door. Before I got to the door, they opened the door without permission. Ha ha, those who stay in the future, especially those who are doing sensitive things, should pay attention to it!!July 2, 2008: when I made a reservation online, I added that ""15F or 16F, it&apos;s better to see Liujiang&apos;s room"", which met my requirements.Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable comments on our service. We apologize for the inconvenience. We will strengthen staff training to avoid similar service errors.The luxury viewing rooms on the 24th-26th floor of our hotel decorated according to the five-star standard will be completed soon. We are looking forward to your visit!!"	1
When the customer service of Dangdang is rubbish and the attitude is extremely bad, I paid an order with a gift card, then cancelled the order and generated a new order. When I wanted to pay with a gift card, I found that the balance of the gift was zero.Then call the customer and reply that it will take 3 to 5 working days for me to return the amount of the gift card.I said how long it took, she said, three to five days passed quickly, and I don&apos;t know if she lives on Mars.Then I asked, what if the goods in my current order are out of stock after 3 to 5 days?The answer is: you can buy it at another time!Is that what people say?It&apos;s obvious that our own system is so rubbish, but we have to ask customers to bear the loss.	0
Too partial place, too cold place, too bad breakfast.Depressed!!Additional comments April 18, 2008: it is suggested that Ctrip should not recommend the past	0
All aspects of the service here do not meet the five-star standard, especially the breakfast	0
It&apos;s very superficial. The discussion is especially like a model essay for primary school students. It&apos;s also a model argumentative essay with a total score and a few examples in the middle.There&apos;s a feeling of being cheated. I don&apos;t like it.	0
The machine is small, the noise is very small, the heat dissipation is also good, the portability is convenient, the CPU performance is good, the memory also passes	1
The content is a little empty, the writing is garrulous and somewhat mystical, which is quite different from the practicality he flaunts.	0
"I don&apos;t like reading very much, but since I bought ""temperature decides life, aging, illness and death"", I have read it several times in a row, and I like it very much. Because my body immunity is very poor, I often catch a cold, and there are many other uncomfortable symptoms. I feel that I have many phenomena mentioned in the book, and I don&apos;t know how to recuperate. I am worried.Now I have started to soak my feet with wormwood leaves. I hope it can be effective. I am also taking tonic food. But I dare not try to eat raw loach. I will have other methods in the book to make fire.If my health has improved, I will also recommend this book to my friends."	1
Quite a lot!The first is heat dissipation. The right side of the touch panel is hot. It&apos;s hard to survive the summer!Notebook on the table is uneven, the lower right corner needs to pad something, indicating that the abrasive process is relatively poor!Even if you don&apos;t have a system installed, then the CD has only a vista driver. It&apos;s a headache for novices to find a driver.	0
The most prosperous area in the moderate price hotel, the room is bigger, harassing the telephone many.	1
The taste is really bad, I can&apos;t accept it!!!The picture is too messy. My 2-year-old son won&apos;t like it. I&apos;m too lazy to watch it.No matter how individual the chicken is, you have to be interested in it first!Buy the failure!!	0
In addition to a small hard disk, can catch up with shanzhaiben, the screen frame is too big, a bit of visual error, but the installation system is very smooth, affordable one word!!!	1
At first, I thought it was true, because at that time I was lovelorn, leading to brain damage.The missing of long distance love can poison one&apos;s love.That&apos;s true.I know to give up.I know something I have to do.No scenery, no literary talent, no traces of works, no exquisite master.It&apos;s just the mood.Pure record.This kind of record is inevitably empty, and fiction is also weak.But for those who fail in long-distance love, it is a cup of warm water, which can irrigate the seemingly withered love ability.The novel really has no art to speak of, for the pursuit of refined reading, watching the Internet version is enough.	1
The environment was pretty good, the service was pretty good.The environment is similar to Shangri La next door, but it&apos;s much cheaper.I wanted to swim, but I was told that the pool was not open for decoration, which was quite depressing.The front desk ladies are more stingy with their smiles.Once you arrive by Mazda, there is no service at the door; once you arrive by imported Audi, someone helps you carry your luggage and get off.No one to help deliver luggage to the room, I guess we are Chinese, no tips.Do you want me to learn two sentences of Japanese?But I don&apos;t want to learn.When eating in the western restaurant on the second floor and drinking tea in the lobby bar on the first floor, I saw a lot of girls dressed up and speaking with different accents. I hope I am wrongIf I guess right, it&apos;s not very comfortable to eat with them in the same place.	1
Room facilities are not good	1
This hotel is OK.But recently I stayed there for more than two nights. As a result, the hotel told Ctrip every time that I left the hotel after only one night. It&apos;s too impolite to affect my points.The hotel makes this point careful, too should not!!!	0
Calorific, without system, random CD only vista system driver, XP driver to download!	0
Our family of three stayed in the oceanwide celebrity hotel from July 19 to 22, 2008, and had read the comments on the Internet before.With the attitude of trying and the professional vision of aviation service, I truly realize that it is worth the money and deserves the reputation.Whether it&apos;s the bright lobby, the floor hall, or the clean guest room, the layout is particularly elegant and comfortable, full of the warmth of home.We live in a sea view room on the fourth floor. It&apos;s really in front of the sea. The flowers are blooming in spring. The windowsill is decorated with beautiful flowers and plants. We can see the endless sea.The trestle is close at hand. When you open the window, the warm sea breeze blows to your face. When you close the window, there is no noise of the city.Let&apos;s really feel that we have come to Qingdao and really enjoy the comfort of the sea view room.In particular, the lobby manager of Pan Hai celebrity, a tall girl with big eyes, is a bit like the youth version of Ni Ping, but more beautiful than the young Ni Ping.The attitude is very kind, and the service for the guests is very considerate. I can really think what the guests think and what they are anxious about.Take the initiative to pay attention to the needs of the guests, timely understand and solve the difficulties for the guests.She always has a smile on her face and is very polite and professional in her actions and words.Even if there is only a drizzle outside, she can be very considerate and take the initiative to send umbrellas to the guests.I think she can be the image ambassador of Qingdao. She is beautiful and dignified, especially with the style and charm of traditional Chinese women.If you go to Qingdao again, you will also live in a famous person from oceanwide. I also hope that more friends will know this excellent, beautiful and generous lobby manager with Oriental female characteristics.Thank you for a wonderful holiday. Thank you for your excellent service.Guests from Beijing 2008 / 08 / 01	1
A lot of what Yu Dan said is misleading the public. Just look at many comments on the Internet. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth watching!!	0
There&apos;s nothing to say about the content of the book. The main reason is that the paper and printing are too poor. The paper used is very rough, worse than ordinary pirated books, and the cutting is not good.The quality of this book sold in physical bookstores is much better than that in Dangdang	0
A woman&apos;s love, life, can be warm, can be silent, can be silent together and endless quarrel.Every woman&apos;s expression of love is released in her own way.Their struggle and blind obedience are all for the love of the bottom of their hearts. The love for their children is selfless, while the love for their lovers is silent.Every silent action and expression is the deposit of love in my heart.In a special era, two women struggle, but in the end, both for love.The author&apos;s delicacy comes from the language and mind, but the expression of the story is still Yan Geling&apos;s best.	1
After reading this book, please new nobles, petty bourgeoisie, middle class and overseas returnees, don&apos;t show your social status and quality by holding the so-called wine cigar watch Provence grass.If you live according to the way of the chronicle of things, your quality of life is really terrible.Therefore, the book is very Oriental and Chinese. It depicts a picture of real life and spiritual world for Chinese people.From this we know that our ancestors can play more than those guys now.	1
The decoration of the room is old, and the sewer is blocked. After more than 2 hours in the evening, it still hasn&apos;t been repaired.	0
It&apos;s a small book that my daughter and I share. The content is a miniature of the original, but it&apos;s complete and interesting. My daughter is still young. If she just reads the words, she doesn&apos;t understand the meaning of it, and it&apos;s easy to stray.Therefore, the advantage of this book is that it has a lot of illustrations, which can be used to tell the baby. The effect is good. It only costs more than 1 yuan to enjoy the wonderful story and parent-child moments. Is it worth the money?My daughter and I are both loyal fans of Thumbelina. We also bought all the other books in this set. We had a good time reading them.	1
To tell you the truth, I didn&apos;t expect that Ctrip would disappoint me too much this time. I have always believed in you. Maybe your enterprise has become bigger now, and we customers who have been quietly supporting you have begun to neglect it, but for an enterprise with service nature as the leader.What you have gradually discarded is not only a group of customers, but also the culture and spirit of your enterprise. If it goes on like this, it will be a fatal injury for an enterprise like you who can obtain market economy advantage only by serving; in such a fierce market economy competition, it will be a fatal injury to survive like this.On the last day, I stayed in the Jingdezhen kaimenzi Hotel recommended by you, which is the worst listed four-star hotel in China. Not only his hardware facilities and services are not flattering, but I was speechless. Before I left, I left a message for them. How can this kind of service be listed as a four-star Hotel at such a price, and how can the local tourism bureau review their level,You Ctrip are too irresponsible. How can you recommend such a hotel to the guests? The carpet in the room has water, and the carpet around the room is all white powder. The bathroom facilities are not as good as those of a 200 year old hotel we lived in Wuyuan. You can see a lot of peeling wallpaper inadvertently. You have to change their wallpaper when you go swimmingSauna clothes, in fact, the first floor can be directly into, asked to know the sauna is contracted out, dizzy!!!The guest room asked them to send some disposable slippers and said that they would charge extra. God, this is the first time I heard such a charge in a four-star hotel. After negotiation, I didn&apos;t accept it. If you don&apos;t believe me, I&apos;ll have a try!!!The only comfort is that the service in the hotel lobby is up to 3-star standard.Ctrip, Ctrip, you should pay attention to it!	0
It&apos;s a good hotel. The address is good. It&apos;s in the center of the city. The hotel staff have a good attitude	1
I don&apos;t know why everyone commented that this book is good, but I can only say that it is general. At least from the point of view of a novel, the author&apos;s literary literacy is really embarrassing to compliment	0
It&apos;s hard to match the 1 GB memory with Vista system.There are a few shortcuts.Compared with HP&apos;s Ott Bluestar speakers, Ott Bluestar speakers always feel inferior.	0
It&apos;s a very good five-star hotel. The room is very big and the facilities are very new. It&apos;s very important. It&apos;s located in the financial center. It&apos;s very convenient to go anywhere. I&apos;ll consider checking in again in the future	1
When I bought this set of books, I was worried about whether it was a little bit childish for my baby to read. When I got home, I found that the story was very simple, Baobao was easy to accept, and I could learn a lot from it. Now through this set of books, Yaoyao knows: 1 what animals do at night, and how animals sleep; 2 what do elephants like to do at ordinary times, and what little ants do before it rains; 3What does a cricket use to make a sound? 4. Gecko&apos;s tail will grow when it&apos;s broken. What other animals will lose their parts in order to protect themselves. 5. How do clouds form and why do they disappear? Overall, this set of books is really good	1
The surrounding area is not very prosperous. It&apos;s basically on the periphery of the city center. The traffic is very convenient and easy to find.I ordered an executive big bed room. The room is average, but it&apos;s not big enough. The price is not low. There are few kinds of breakfast. The swimming pool is not small, but I didn&apos;t bring swimming trunks. I didn&apos;t try it.The service level is OK. I feel that it is up to the standard and the price is reasonable. I will consider moving in in the future.	1
The keyboard is not used to it, especially the cursor keys are too small.The cooling part is not as good as ThinkPad, but it&apos;s reasonable.	0
1It&apos;s very light, and the power supply is small. It&apos;s usually carried around in a big bag. The load is much lighter. It&apos;s cool. It used to be 12.1 inches of Dell, which is much heavier than Xiaohei. 2. The noise is low, and the operation is basically silent. 3. The heat dissipation is good, and the temperature is not high for a long time	1
The sound insulation design of the room is really not good, the walls and glass walls are obviously not blocked, the others are OK.	1
The driver support is perfect. The only thing is that AMD has a large amount of heat dissipation. I hope there won&apos;t be any problems in one or two years	0
It&apos;s very bad. My friend took me there once, because the Royal Spa there is more attractive. As a result, although the room in the south building is known to be worse than that in the main building, I didn&apos;t expect it to be like that. Where is the four-star one...Not as good as the guest house downstairs.It&apos;s a very small room, a very small bed, 1 meter wide, super hard, and the bedding is very uncomfortable. The TV has a set-top box, but there are no more than 20 sets. It&apos;s 21 inches. It&apos;s not clear, so it&apos;s hard to watch.The room is not soundproof. I always hear the door opening and closing of other people&apos;s rooms. The most exaggerated thing is that I wanted to go to sleep until I woke up naturally. As a result, I got up at 7 a.m. because my parents got up early and walked by my room door. They whispered, don&apos;t call her. I&apos;m sure I didn&apos;t wake up...Actually, I woke up, as if someone said in my ear...Originally, spa was quite good, but the next day I started to have a rash on my body on my way back to Guangzhou in the afternoon. So did my friend who went with me. The scene was not good, and my whole body was long, with small blisters in the center. It was extremely itchy. I didn&apos;t know whether it was allergic or infectious dermatitis. Anyway, it was not a good thing.In the end, there is only a little left. There is a swimming pool downstairs, which is more convenient. For the sake of objectivity, I still need to write it out.Don&apos;t go. It&apos;s like being cheated. I was in a good mood for a holiday, but I got angry and sick.Supplementary comments on August 16, 2008: Wow, I noticed that someone in front of me was 99, so I lost a lot. I went to the spa package of South Building 298.	0
Look cheap to buy, it&apos;s very bad, but there&apos;s no benefit after reading, just find an online reading online, there&apos;s no need to waste 10 yuan	0
"Very classic books are also very exquisite. I feel very excited to get hold of them. They are fluent in writing, easy to understand, and go deeper into life. They connect psychological theory and knowledge with people&apos;s daily life and work, making it an excellent book for the general public to understand psychology and themselves!As the author said, ""psychology is a science closely related to human happiness"". Its unique style of close to life and in-depth practice is also a good book for the general public to understand psychology, better understand human nature and improve their overall quality."	1
There is no CD-ROM driver attached. When installing the system, you have to go to HP&apos;s official website to download the driver, which is more troublesome	0
Due to the new decoration in 2007, there are some new problems that may not have been solved. I often have to live there because of work needs, so I carefully put forward the following opinions and suggestions: 1. After the new decoration, the position of the shower head in the shower room of the single room is too high, and it is not easy to use when I change the room2. Some of the management and services after the new opening are not in place, especially in the front desk check-in and check-out times, the efficiency is too low (each check-out is more than 10 minutes, it seems that it does not meet the requirements of the four star hotel)	1
Ridicule history with modern commercial language, and when you look at the first page, you don&apos;t want to see it again. In terms of historical content, it&apos;s extremely difficult to achieve the same interpretation as Luo Guanzhong&apos;s Romance of the three kingdoms or Er Yuehe&apos;s Emperor Yongzheng,If it&apos;s an ordinary novel, humor is OK. It&apos;s hard to accept such a presentation on historical issues. All this always makes people feel that the reading atmosphere is becoming more impetuous. Fewer and fewer people are willing to settle down and devote themselves to reading. No wonder publishers and authors conform to this trend in other elements,But in the book itself content essential factor, has neglected more and more	0
The service was very good, the environment was also very good, very comfortable, the restaurant was also very comfortable, very warm.	1
I envy the heroine very much. Although she grew up in an orphanage, just as she said, it is because she grew up in an orphanage that she can realize all kinds of fun she can enjoy after going to university. Unlike those girls with superior family conditions, they feel that everything is taken for granted. New clothes, dances and tourism can not make them as excited as herThe most important thing is that the person she loves most is watching her silently, caring for her, and finally coming together with her. What is more enviable than that?	1
It&apos;s a rotten hotel. When I went to the front desk to register, there was only one attendant. The attendant called my colleague by his name. My colleague also smelled that it was his beautiful college classmate calling him. The so-called business room we lived in was on the 7th floor, and the elevator could only go to the 6th floor. When I came to the room, I found that the 7th floor should be converted into a guest room later. Maybe it was an illegal building, and the toilet was very small, so I bought itThe kind of integrated product used on airplanes.The room can&apos;t get on the Internet, and the phone can&apos;t jump up after pressing a button. I went to my colleague&apos;s room to call the waiter. After a long time, I ran up to two stunned northeast younger sisters with warm-hearted attitude, but I could see that they were rookies.	0
It&apos;s unimaginable that the room is so bad. The carpet is so dirty. There are two groups of suspected spider webs hanging on the ceiling that haven&apos;t been cleaned for many years. Maybe it&apos;s four-star rated ten years ago, but now it&apos;s two-star rated. It&apos;s suggested to cancel all the star rated hotels in China. It&apos;s a deceptive thing	0
The service attitude of the service staff was very bad. They didn&apos;t charge room fees according to the hotel regulations and charged indiscriminately,	0
"""I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on in my heart, but the wind and water are falling in front of me.""In the Song Dynasty, beauty and sadness coexisted. The turbulent history of the Song Dynasty was left in his unique feeling and polished by time.Those old things, is history, is the history of the word, but also the history of the heart, it light touch your heart, take you into a real through.Zhang Xilin is a sensitive person. I don&apos;t know why, Song Ci poems are so perfectly interpreted by him. The soft words and clear sentences interpret Song Ci Poems into stories, telling you through the dusty history and hazy moonlight."	1
Originally, I thought there would be some words with illustrations. As a result, the whole page of the picture is too simple and has no connotation. Just like the baby pictorial, the content is not rich enough and the price is not cheap	0
1The location and environment are good. 2. The breakfast is OK. 3. The service is good, especially the indoor swimming pool facilities are comfortable. 4. The room is old, especially the slippers are too thin to be a four-star hotel	1
Good location, rich breakfast and fast Internet access.It&apos;s just that it&apos;s no longer managed by Marriott. I hope the service level will not drop	1
The environment is good, the transportation is very convenient, the shopping and eating are also convenient, the company to Tianjin business is to stay in this hotel!	1
It&apos;s not as good as the publicity, and it&apos;s not so practical, and it&apos;s not so entertaining. Now there&apos;s no one to support it. I really don&apos;t know what to do with this book???	0
Heat dissipation is not good. As soon as it gets hot, the system slows down. Ah, buying a heat sink doesn&apos;t work. It&apos;s depressing	0
I like this book very much. I can learn from it.Lala is a lucky girl. In addition to her own efforts, the reason for her success is that she has very good opportunities and some kind guides.The reality is that even if you make efforts, there will not be good returns.But if you work hard, you will succeed when the opportunity comes.Don&apos;t complain about unfairness. People are born unequal.Simple life, simple heart.	0
Whether it&apos;s a novel or a workplace textbook, it&apos;s wonderful; whether it&apos;s a job in a foreign enterprise, a state-owned enterprise, or a civil servant, it&apos;s worth learning and reference; men can also read it, and they will get something	0
"Objectively speaking, this is one of the hotels of the same class that I have stayed in. Both the overall environment and room facilities are really ""bad enough"" as one commenter said.I don&apos;t want to say more. I won&apos;t go there in the future!May 31, 2008: one thing I forgot just now was that I didn&apos;t feel happy. When I went to check in, I felt as if I owed her more and paid her less. I almost didn&apos;t force me to go to her boss because I loved to take care of her!"	0
Infected by the author&apos;s attitude towards life!But the method introduced in it is still according to one&apos;s ability, according to one&apos;s own constitution, because not everyone&apos;s constitution is as good as a little beauty.I saw the tomato and cucumber juice, which has whitening effect. As a result, after drinking it, I had a stomachache for an afternoon and also had endocrine disorder. The reason is that these two kinds of things are too cold. I seem to have a cool constitution again, so I can imagine the consequences of drinking them.So, don&apos;t listen to or believe anything. Check it out before you use it. Don&apos;t follow me.	1
There is no worse room than this, near the railway station.The service was average	0
Perfect screen.The graphics card is 65nm, estimated to be 9300GS vest, NVIDIA&apos;s old trick, it is estimated that if you continue to play like this, NV will go out of business.Gateway is not responsible for this. After all, the price of 3999 is there.The video memory is DDR2.Heat dissipation is really good, but the online evaluation is not entirely gun text.Upgraded to 4GB memory, it&apos;s OK to use.Play WOW settings more debugging several times, you can drive to a good level and keep smooth (full screen 1366x768 oh).	1
I ordered an executive room, but the hotel gave me a free upgrade to an apartment, which is their new house. The room facilities and decoration are very good, and the check-out can be delayed to 3 o&apos;clock. The location is good, the transportation is convenient, and the dining area is also convenient. If I go to Nanjing next time, I will stay here. I like it very much	1
It&apos;s been a while since I bought it. My three-year-old doesn&apos;t like to watch it.On the one hand, the cartoon modeling is not very concise and clear. On the other hand, many things do not appear in our Chinese habits, so we can&apos;t explain them to our children.There is also the name and language used in the book, which children are not used to.I don&apos;t know why this set of books is still the first best seller. The parents of the children around me bought them for fame and left them idle at home.	0
Promised to buy a computer to send a bag, but to disaster relief almost a month, has not sent, ready to return, dishonest, after buying things must be all things can pay	0
I haven&apos;t seen the Japanese version, but after reading it, I feel suitable.The content is very light, there is no deep meaning.The drawing is not very good.	0
There are too few kinds of breakfast, the transportation is quite convenient, and the service attitude is not very good. I asked the hotel that the map I bought was taken by other old rooms	1
The configuration is OK, and the performance is stable.There is no problem with the game, it runs very quiet, but the heat dissipation is not good.I don&apos;t know whether the quality is good or not, because it doesn&apos;t take long. I know the horsepower from afar, ha ha!!!!	1
There is a dark spot on the screen. There is a slight scratch on the shell. The sound of the CD-ROM drive is a bit like Ferrari	0
It&apos;s very sad that zoologists a hundred years ago were able to write such a good popular science book suitable for children&apos;s taste. Even I, as an adult, learned a lot. When I read the first book, we read it together with our parents. Later, the children read it by themselves. I really can&apos;t put it down. I read it before I go to bed at night, and when I get up in the morning, I pucker up and lie on the bed.Need to remind is: if your child is small, under the age of 8, you&apos;d better help him consolidate the effect of reading, such as asking a question about the knowledge in the book.All in all, books are very good!It&apos;s worth buying!	1
The network speed is fast, and it is convenient for VPN to connect to the company&apos;s intranet. The person in charge of it has set up the network well. Praise it.But the attitude of the front desk staff is not up to the standard of satisfaction.There was no iron in the hotel. To meet the customer, I had to ask for ironing a shirt. I said five yuan, but I charged eight yuan when I checked out. I said three yuan for service charge and urgent charge.When I opened the door of the glass shower, I found that my right hand must be at least 2 meters long to reach the bath towel, so I had to drop water to get it.After thinking about it, the bath towel can&apos;t be brought into the small shower. I don&apos;t know who designed it.Did not find more advantages than other hotels, 560 yuan ocean spent a little injustice, no longer.	0
The appearance of the machine is very good, and the HP brand is very reliable.In terms of configuration, I think it&apos;s very cost-effective	1
In addition, the heat dissipation design of this book is too powerful. The CPU and the north bridge chip are covered with an aluminum sheet. The aluminum sheet is very thin and light, and the fan just plays the role of exhausting air and making the air flow.This kind of heat dissipation is very worrying. I don&apos;t know if other netbooks are designed in this way.	0
Better than you think.It seems that the golden key alliance still has certain quality control.The room facilities are OK, but the smoke smell is too heavy.Come back, my pajamas smell of smoke.Breakfast is very common, with few choices.But the service ecology of Pakistan is very good.It&apos;s just beside the Yalu River. The surrounding environment is OK	1
There&apos;s no big disadvantage. Anyway, netbooks can&apos;t have too high performance requirements. To be honest, the disadvantage is that after XP is reinstalled, I feel that the running speed is not as fast as expected	0
When my boyfriend saw the introduction of this book in the newspaper, he blew it to heaven, so he asked me to buy one for him. Dangdang delivery meeting was very fast, and I received it in three days. As soon as I read it, I was just a junk book. Now I have to start to buy books, and let people live! I read it, or go to some dietotherapy net to have a look, which is much better than this book!	0
In a word, that&apos;s pretty bad!It&apos;s also called three stars. There&apos;s no mistake. There&apos;s no hotel standard.The hall is passable.The smell of disinfectant in the room is so strong that I can&apos;t get used to it for half an hour.Things in the bathroom feel like they&apos;re in a 50 yuan shop, with glass cracks made of cement paste.Oh, my God, I&apos;m so humiliated.Strongly request a refund!	0
After a week, I checked in again. This time I ordered a business big bed room. It seems that the original Deluxe big bed room can&apos;t be ordered. There are more fax machines in the business room, more bathtubs in the bathroom and a big window on the wall. However, the room seems small and the price is 100 yuan higher, which is acceptable. However, I still think the deluxe room is more practical and spacious.I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because of the business room.The hotel is still very comfortable, and the details still need to be improved, such as the large window on the wall between the bathroom and the room, the glass is very beautiful, but can you consider adding blinds, otherwise it will be inconvenient for visitors to use the bathroom.This time, the restaurant didn&apos;t turn off the light at 8 p.m. and it seems to be still open. I don&apos;t know if the last suggestion worked. If so, I should like one.The hotel used to have an underground parking lot. This time my car was parked underground. Although it was more complicated to go up and down stairs, there was a spacious parking space. The old man in charge of the garage was very responsible. I felt good.	1
It&apos;s much heavier than I expected. There are too few USB ports.Also, the vista system starts too slowly. Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m not used to it.	0
"My baby likes it very much. Now he is one year old and nine months old.But I bought it when he was 8 months old. I also saw the comments and thought it was very good. Let&apos;s buy it.When he was one year old and when he read the book ""gale"", he was able to understand it and liked it very much. After reading it many times, he noticed the tiny things in the picture and often asked himself questions and answers, which was very lovely.And this picture book content, quality is good, as long as the baby like I am very satisfied.He is not very interested in some of them. I think he will like them as he grows older!"	1
However, installing vista system is the best. I have installed two different ghost XP, but there are some small problems. I&apos;d better only install vista. Now I haven&apos;t found anything wrong	0
The location is generally recognized as good, but there are also many disadvantages, mainly the elevator is slow, the corridor is narrow, and the room facilities are a little old. It&apos;s OK to stay temporarily for one night. It&apos;s not recommended to stay for a long time.	0
"After reading it, the book was printed delicately, but the content: kimchi woman&apos;s murmuring to herself is very common!The overall feeling of this book is ""better known than met"".It&apos;s suggested to download a copy on the Internet. Don&apos;t spend money on it."	0
I think I love Sun Bo...Her love is so simple, so passionate.I think in the deepest part of her heart, the person she loves is still Xiaolang...There are waves, there are waves...There are waves, there are waves.It&apos;s classic..I have this book.Read every word carefully.Their love and hate.I think if I do it again.They will be together.Although from the beginning has been full of sadness and frustrations.But, always can feel their love is so real....	1
The hotel&apos;s facilities are very good, the room is big, the facilities are new, the bed and quilt are very new.The toilet is also dry and wet separation.The attitude of the waiters is also very good. They say hello when they go in and out.There are too few tables for 2-3 people in the dining hall.Also has is the house price should belong to the high side in Quzhou.	1
Customers visit Foshan factory and arrange to stay in this old Samsung hotel. Although the room facilities are a little successful, the price is not expensive. The key is located in the city center, so it is very convenient for shopping and eating.For this house price, it&apos;s OK.	1
Domestic OEM, the design of the battery part is unreasonable. After the battery is installed, the side parallel to the keyboard is a little higher, which may contact with the screen.	0
The view of the lake view room is very good!The hotel is also very clean, but the facilities are a little old.The traffic is very convenient!Taxis in Xiamen are too expensive. It&apos;s convenient to take buses from hotels to scenic spots.However, the breakfast in the hotel is very general, with few choices and almost repeated every day.	1
Things are good. I bought a package of memory and other accessories. Other things are not cheap, but the computer itself is good. After all, I don&apos;t have to run	1
Jingdong&apos;s processing speed is very fast; the screen doesn&apos;t have to say; the keyboard feels good (mainly for this brand); there is a rocker;	1
This is not so much a novel as a simple and systematic self-improvement package.If you can follow the rules of eating slowly, you will benefit a lot and a lifetime.In the book, the author let Ruoling lead the readers to approach their own truth step by step, explore themselves, discover themselves, accept themselves, improve themselves, and finally reach the realm of self perfection.It points out a shortcut for all living beings to communicate with the Buddha of self nature.This book is easy to read and contains profound philosophy.It&apos;s a rare textbook for spiritual education!	1
"When children ask how they were born?When there are such topics as why there are children, it is probably the way for most parents to prevaricate their children.It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t want to say it, but I really don&apos;t know how to say it and where to start, because our parents at the beginning also looked at this kind of problem very evasively and vaguely.Occasionally, I found this book ""tell the truth to children"" in the library. Let me wash my mind first. It&apos;s a normal thing. It&apos;s often complicated by adults. This book teaches me how to guide children about sex and love. It&apos;s real and natural. It&apos;s really a good book....!"	1
Service is OK, room size is moderate, but clothing and facilities are quite old. Hotel feedback 14 January 2008: Thank you for your recognition of our service, we will try our best in other aspects. Welcome to visit again!	1
To be honest, I&apos;ve been booking rooms with the help of Cheng. I always think it&apos;s very convenient. But this time, the rooms here can&apos;t be occupied. Even if they stick to the side of the Convention and Exhibition Center, it&apos;s not like this. If you have a car, you still live in the city, so it&apos;s convenient to drive to the venue. We used to live in Xujiahui and drive here. As a result, when we entered the room, the walls were mottled, the windows were leaking, and it was thumping when we walked up,It&apos;s like a shed. The room is very cold at night, and it&apos;s useless to turn on the air conditioner at 30 degrees! If you don&apos;t have a car, it&apos;s convenient to check in next to the subway. In short, don&apos;t live here in Pudong, Shanghai!!	0
Eight of us ordered two Sea View Deluxe rooms and a deluxe standard room. By accident, our family lived in room 2104. The scenery was really good. We could see not only the sea, but also the city and the night.It&apos;s a big room. It&apos;s clean and well equipped.The disadvantage is that the window glass is a little dirty. The window can only be opened a little. There is water leakage in the ceiling beside the window. When I went in, I put two pots to receive water. The tap of the bathroom is too high. The shower can&apos;t be adjusted. The water is too open.The surrounding environment is also very good. It&apos;s convenient for eating and shopping. A Taiwanese restaurant next to the hotel has a good taste.Generally speaking, I&apos;m very satisfied. If I have the chance to come back to Weihai, I&apos;ll stay here.	1
A few months later, I checked in again. As soon as I entered the hall, a female staff member could name me, which was very unusual.The service is not that bad. The location of the hotel is also very good. It&apos;s located in the center of Weihai.	1
I bought it after reading the comments of other readers. I don&apos;t know why many people think it&apos;s good.After reading one-third of the book, I really feel that what I have said is meaningless. I feel that I have no harvest. I can find the content by searching the Internet.It&apos;s not helpful. It&apos;s the most disappointing book I&apos;ve ever bought.	0
Just after watching the bean sprout collection (1), the overall feeling is that you can write whatever you want, including people, events, feelings, memories and scenery. At first glance, you feel rough, but you still feel reasonable when you savor it carefully.Although everyone&apos;s environment is different, these short words can touch a chord in your heart from time to time.Sometimes there are many different feelings about the situations or things she describes, but it&apos;s this difference that makes you feel like you can read on and on.Just write and read as you please. Good!It&apos;s easy!	1
"Old stories in the south of the city is the first literary book I read when I was in college. I didn&apos;t notice that it was written by a famous writer at that time. I was only deeply attracted by the old photo like scenes and the slightly sentimental flowing words in the aftertaste. Now I find her again and treasure her. It&apos;s a memory of university life and the aftertaste of the past years.I like one of yingzi&apos;s father&apos;s words: ""no matter what difficult things, as long as you stick to it, you will pass.""I am also wandering and firm between the ""rush"" in the past a lot of things, I am very lucky, read such a text."	1
Every time I order a hotel, I check the comments on the Internet and find that the hotel&apos;s evaluation is good and the price is reasonable.In addition to booking a room for myself, I also ordered a room for my clients.After arriving, it was really good. The hotel upgraded my room considering my contact with customers.It&apos;s my first time to meet the upgrade. I&apos;m happy.The room is spacious and clean. The waiters are warm and deliver fruit.Because of geography, the scenery outside the window is not very good.But it&apos;s close to Vientiane City, and he&apos;s happy to take customers for a walk.If you go to Shenzhen again, if you don&apos;t go to Hong Kong, you will still live here.Because I was busy, I came to comment after 20 days.If you want to go to Hong Kong, you can choose the store in rujiayucun community. There are restaurants, fruit shops and drugstores downstairs. It&apos;s very convenient.It&apos;s just a little hard to find.	1
Do you have a good quality?It&apos;s incredible. After I bought it, the first thing I felt was that the packaging was too bad. The CDs were banging in the cartons, and it was easy to rub. I tried it. There were 10 discs in total, and seven of them couldn&apos;t be read out. It&apos;s really cheap. I don&apos;t have good products. I suggest you be careful what you want to buy. The quality is not as good as the pirated version. It should be very bad pirated.	0
Generally speaking, the most unbearable thing in hotels is the harassment phone. It rings 4-5 times a night, and it calls every night. For single men, the information is very accurate. I seriously suspect that it is the young lady who settles the front desk attendant and gets the guest&apos;s check-in information.Living in such a room, I feel very uneasy.	0
The appearance is beautiful, the function indicator is also very good-looking, the price is more cost-effective than Zhongguancun.It&apos;s suitable for girls. It&apos;s OK to watch movies and listen to music	0
After installing XP system, the driver of wireless network card is difficult to find. The signal is very unstable after installation, and I don&apos;t know what the problem is. When I start up, the CD-ROM drive will sound Kara Kara	0
Nice appearance, comfortable keyboard, easy to use touchpad.Good screen, Fujitsu series top screen.There are camera, Bluetooth, wireless, card reader, DVD burning, fingerprint.Anyway, the equipment is complete.	1
The only advantage of this hotel is its good location, close to Xujiahui subway station and convenient shopping.The sound insulation of the room is quite poor, the mattress is also very hard, there is basically nothing to eat for breakfast, and the attitude of the waiter is also very general.There is another charge for surfing the Internet, 44 a day, 0.44 a minute. The Internet speed is OK, but it&apos;s always offline.The attitude of the front desk staff is average, but the restaurant staff is even worse. They basically stand there chatting together.In the future, I would rather stay far away than choose this hotel.	0
The environment of the hotel is OK. It&apos;s very good in the local area. The room is relatively large, but the equipment is average.Free registration website navigation Hotel index service description about Ctrip is looking for talents to cooperate in advertising business contact us copyright 1999-2008,ctrip.com. all rights reserved.	1
It&apos;s quite good. The quality of licensed goods is guaranteed.As for the price, it&apos;s cheaper, although it&apos;s more expensive than parallel products.Bluetooth, camera and fingerprint are not necessary	1
Linux to watch a movie and listen to music will be installed XP card, so trouble, I have been bad luck!!	0
Advantages: it is located in a prosperous area, and the waiters are very friendly.Disadvantages: because it&apos;s close to the road, it&apos;s noisy at night and I didn&apos;t sleep well.I went back to my room at noon the next day and found that I didn&apos;t clean my room.Hotel feedback August 13, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay in four seasons West Lake Hotel.Sorry for the unpleasant hotel you stayed in this time. If you have certain requirements on the cleaning time of the guest room, please dial the push to talk on the landline in the room, and the front desk will inform the housekeeping department to clean your room in time.Thank you for your comments and look forward to your coming again!	0
The overall service was pretty good, but the sound insulation in the room was too poor, the sound in the corridor was just like that in the room, and the breakfast was OK	1
"My son is one year old and eight months old.My son takes out several copies of this set of books every day for me to tell him.And it has a great influence on children&apos;s behavior.For example: sleep.Children always play until 11 or 2 o&apos;clock every day and still refuse to go to bed. Yesterday, I saw that he was still in a good mood, but it was late. It was 11 o&apos;clock, so I asked the child to lie down, turn off the light, take pictures of him and tell him the story of ""sleeping"" in this series. Alas, he soon stopped making noise and fell asleep.If he lay down for half an hour, he would not be quiet."	1
On a business trip to Beijing with my colleagues, I chose Zhongchuan hotel after consulting in advance, so I reserved two rooms of Zhongchuan hotel from May 17 to 20 on Ctrip.On that day, the plane was delayed for 3 hours. For fear of not being able to check in the hotel as scheduled, he called the hotel headquarters after arriving in Beijing and asked to reserve the room.The front desk attendant replied warmly that he would keep it, so he felt relieved.Zhongchuan hotel is located in Yuetan North Street, about 100 meters away from Sanlihe East Road and 50 meters away from Yuetan North Street to the north. It&apos;s quite quiet. In the middle of the night, it&apos;s not affected by the sound of people and cars on the road outside, so it&apos;s suitable for rest.I stayed in a big bed room, with a total area of about 4.5 meters, 3 meters = 13.5 square meters, including 1.5 meters in the bathroom, 2 meters = 3 square meters (about one bed), 2.8 meters in the bedroom, 3 meters = 8.4 square meters.The floor in the bedroom is a bit like a wooden floor. There is a 1.5-meter-wide bed, a wooden wardrobe, a bedside cabinet, a round table, two seats, and a long wooden table (including a square stool). The long wooden table is equipped with color TV and table lamp, and the round table is equipped with electric kettle, four cups and jasmine tea.The room is equipped with self-adjusting air conditioning.The most satisfied ones are: firstly, there is basically no musty smell in the room that many hotels often smell, and the smell is good; secondly, the pillows, quilts, sheets and stools are very clean and tidy, and obviously they should be newly purchased.The bathroom is also clean. There is hot water supply all day, but the sound insulation effect is slightly poor. When the guest in the next room turns on and off the tap in the bathroom, there is an obvious water sound.Every day, the waiters clean the room in time, and behave in a standard and civilized manner.Overall evaluation, the room as a personal rest is more satisfactory.There is a restaurant beside the front desk on the first floor of the hotel. Breakfast is a buffet every day, which costs 10 yuan (which can be charged into the room fee). Generally, there are fried dough sticks, fried dough cakes, steamed buns, rolls, boiled eggs, tea eggs, fried poached eggs, corn porridge, mung bean porridge, soya bean milk, milk, cold dishes, salted vegetables, Sufu and other dishes, which are quite abundant and worth the price.It&apos;s very convenient to take a taxi from the hotel.Not far from the east of the hotel is the famous financial street. Not far from the west is Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. It costs about 12 yuan to take a taxi from Yuetan North Street to Xidan. I walked back to the hotel from Xidan one night. It took about an hour. If you have nothing to do, you can go around and have a look. It&apos;s convenient.There are some food stalls around the hotel, such as snack spots and gear stalls. It&apos;s very convenient to eat. After leaving the hotel, there is a 24-hour convenience store 200 meters north. You can buy many daily necessities suitable for consumption at any time.	1
Hotel facilities are very good, service is also very thoughtful, especially the front desk, and welcome, very warm, thank them!	1
Look cheap to buy, it&apos;s very bad, but there&apos;s no benefit after reading, just find an online reading online, there&apos;s no need to waste 10 yuan	0
The hotel is terrible for this price. The lobby is very bad and dirty. I ordered a business suite. There are no windows in the living room and the lights are dim. All the washing supplies, including towels, are of poor quality. There is a smell in the room. When I use my laptop to surf the Internet, it&apos;s good and bad. Later, I simply can&apos;t connect it. I have to use my own wireless to be better than it. Anyway, I won&apos;t think about this one any more	0
The hotel is located in the center of the city, the room is also good, next to a Fushan park. Breakfast is not very rich	1
The environment is first-class, the courtyard is deep, the small bridge is flowing, the withered vine is old, the tree is faint.Multiple check-in.It&apos;s just that the breakfast is extremely bleak, no matter Chinese or western, I hope it can be improved.	1
When I bought this so-called best seller for the first time, I wanted to get an education. Maybe I read too many books on philosophy, and I feel that the author&apos;s writing is very brainless and plain... A good book can either inspire people to learn to think in it, or it is purely pragmatic. This book is written by little girls, which is neither learned nor pragmatic, and it is purely on paper,It&apos;s superficial. It&apos;s not worth reading. In other words, such books can&apos;t be on my shelf. Reading such books is a waste of time	0
Cost performance is very high!The original package is also very good. I picked it up by myself. I went to Zhangyang road in Shanghai once before. Compared with the last time, there are some improvements: DIY seats for customers and wireless network access service. It&apos;s good	1
"Twenty four histories, totally 63, Zhonghua Book Company.It&apos;s like buying a set of comic books when I was a child: first I went to the bookstore to choose the version and price, then I went to the bookstore again and again, finally after many comparisons and choices, I looked for opportunities to ask my parents.After asking his wife, he immediately took out part of the stock income and bought more. These things can be left to his son and affect his growth.After moving home, immediately move the old books in the bookcase to the bottom of the bed, and put these magnificent works in a conspicuous place. It&apos;s a ""happy new and tired old""."	1
This is a practical book, with its concise language attached Montesquieu&apos;s background, life, and other works, just like a short biography!The gist of on the spirit of law is anti church, anti autocracy, separation of powers, and geographical environment determinism.It can be called the collection of witticisms and heart sayings in Montesquieu&apos;s on the spirit of law.This is a good choice for those who want to know Montesquieu, but are limited in time and energy to read the original!It involves Chinese elements, which can also be called the advantages of this book!	1
Look at your comments on the Internet, oh, I&apos;m 4 whose son bought it.But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s time to read to such a young child.This book should be suitable for children over 6 years old.And the story is not interesting.	0
The environment and service are quite good. The biggest drawback is that it&apos;s very inconvenient to take a taxi in the morning.It often takes 10 minutes to wait	1
Things are very small, beautiful appearance, the effect of pearl paint, appearance technology is still good, good plastic mold, speed is also very good.	1
Each time the wireless function is turned on, you need to use the combination key to turn it on again.It&apos;s troublesome to install your own system. You need to solve all kinds of software conflicts and Internet settings.It is necessary to fill in too much personal information when registering the battery extended life card.	0
The hotel is known as the best in Manchuria at present. As soon as you enter the hotel, you are disappointed. The room is very small, not clean, the facilities are not complete, and the hotel service is very slow. The charging Wireless Network is as fast as the old cow pulling a car, and it often needs to be disconnected. The buffet on the first floor is also very poor. Generally speaking, it is not a recommended Hotel, but in places like Manchuria, you also have little choice,Unless the new Shangri La Hotel is completed	0
The hotel is very old and small. It&apos;s dark in the corridor. It&apos;s actually a small hotel facility.Suggest not to, Jilin Province Hotel is not bad.	0
"I have always wanted to own and read all of Eileen Chang&apos;s works carefully. I like the Shanghai flavor in her heart. Although she has a long history and changes in time and space, it&apos;s still like yesterday&apos;s things that happened around her today. I didn&apos;t find all of her works until I was in dangdangli (it&apos;s a pity to read little Reunion).This person has gone, just want to find her shadow again, also like reliving the childhood holding a yellow ""red rose, white rose"" that kind of ignorant, that kind of excitement, that kind of impulse.Thanks for Dangdang&apos;s considerate service. I&apos;m sorry that it&apos;s time to express my opinion today."	1
It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve bought such an expensive one with a notebook. At the beginning, I was worried about it, because I don&apos;t know whether the Dongdong of Jingdong is good or not. Now I think it&apos;s really cheap and good to buy things in Jingdong, and the delivery is very fast. The goods ordered yesterday were received today.Next time, I will shop in Jingdong.	1
In a sad and depressed day, I read this book.Those who have tiptoed over the time, unknowingly has become the time forever in the past.Beautiful high school campus, I am not the experience, but the past.Behind the words, reveals a familiar and cordial taste.Those growth stories, you and I have more or less experienced.It&apos;s growing in a similar way.Like solitude, my way with color, text.A steady stream of strength.From the bottom of my heart, slowly rising warm.Anyway, smile.Brave to meet my future.	1
The transportation is convenient. The price is low near the International Exhibition Center. It&apos;s suitable to stay here.The hotel front desk didn&apos;t admit that I had made a mistake about my reservation information in Ctrip. The quality of the service staff was a little poor.	1
The performance is a little worse than expected. When I watch movies online, the fan keeps turning. I feel that the running ability is a little difficult.	0
I bought it for my sister. She told me that she also bought it.It&apos;s good to give it to other friends	1
The price of this book is too expensive, and it&apos;s not suitable for children over 5 years old to read. The pages are too few and expensive, so it&apos;s not worth buying!It&apos;s not worth buying.	0
The child first saw pictures in other books, a set of three books, including why I hate that girl, why I hate wearing underpants, and why I hate drinking milk. After reading the book, the child asked me what kind of book I was. At first, I was most interested in why I hate wearing underpants. But after a few days of comparison, she decided to buy why I hate that girl (I stipulated that I could only choose one book at a time).When I first bought it back, I had to talk about it every day, sometimes several times a day. If I listen to it too much, if you don&apos;t tell it to her, she will tell it by herself.Not bad.But I&apos;m a little worried about misleading the little girl.	1
"I&apos;m ready to be deeply moved when I see the high praise from readers, but I&apos;m a little disappointed. The more I see the shadow of Korean dramas.Also writing about cancer, I appreciate the great ""auspicious period"", which can move me to tears.In this story, although Lichuan is very affectionate, he is too stubborn. He didn&apos;t know what the other party really wanted until the end, which made the people he loves suffer for many years.Readers are tired to watch. How can we not support each other and cherish the few days left?Maybe I don&apos;t agree with Lichuan&apos;s practice, so it&apos;s hard to resonate."	1
"After reading the introduction of the book, I bought it and tried to show it to my son.The pictures in these books are exquisite, and the implied meaning is clear. Children can understand them as soon as they read them. They are indeed the masterpieces of the picture book master, Mayer.Although there is not a single word in the whole book, through the pictures, the author wants to express the meaning very clearly, and use the humorous ""telling"" process to let children know why they want friends, what is the friendship between friends, and how to treat new friends.These are the same things children will face.Through pictures, they can understand the truth more deeply."	1
The luxury single room is 1 / 3 smaller than the double room, and the facilities are also poor. There is no coffee table and armchair, but the price is much more expensive than the double room. It&apos;s really incredible! I&apos;m a regular guest of the double room in the hotel.Maybe the hotel itself doesn&apos;t feel reliable. When I go out, I quietly move in two armchairs and replace the armchair in the original room. However, because the room space is too small, the chair can&apos;t sit and can only put things!The front desk service was fairly good. I forgot my ID card. I told them that I was a regular customer. After checking the computer information, I let them check in.	0
The style of this machine is really ordinary. It has a strong sense of plastic. When the back cover is removed, the baffle is very thin.Memory is not on the Internet that DDR2 667 is 800, but I bought 667 memory, I don&apos;t know if it can be dual channel	0
As soon as I saw the book, I was very happy. The printing quality was very good, but after only one day&apos;s reading, I took off the page and lost one page after another. I was depressed!I don&apos;t know how to explain Dangdang?	0
Intercontinental Hotel, Ctrip&apos;s price is really competitive.It should be the cheapest five-star hotel in Shenyang.1) Location: it is located near Taiyuan street, commercial street, with convenient transportation, but there is always traffic jam at the door. It is suggested to take a taxi across the road from the hotel.2) Room: it&apos;s very small, but it has a good view of the street.3) The fitness center doesn&apos;t take photos, and other similar hotels don&apos;t have such regulations. 4) the service at the entrance of the concierge department is not good, maybe because it&apos;s too cold in Shenyang in winter, people don&apos;t come out to meet the guests.5) The worst thing is: ask the concierge to take a taxi to the airport. Before getting on the bus, they ask the hotel if they charge by meter. After confirmation, they get on the bus. As a result, when they arrive at the airport, they ask for a fare of 50 yuan. The driver shouts 100!!At that time, there was no investigation for the reason of catching up with the plane. Afterwards, the complaint against intercontinental was still unresolved.Quite disappointed!	1
In such a hotel, the front desk clerk kindly reminds us that the reservation room is noisy (close to the elevated line), because only such a room has the charging broadband. After checking the room, I feel that it is OK, but the waiter can&apos;t wait 10 minutes to go downstairs to register, instead, he requests to register immediately, as if we are worried that we will steal their things	0
The manual is relatively simple. I don&apos;t know how to install the Samsung memory for this laptop. Although it&apos;s written in the manual, because I don&apos;t have experience in this field, I plan to go to the warranty center and ask professionals to install it for me, so it&apos;s a little troublesome.	0
It&apos;s supposed to be a deluxe suite, but it&apos;s not Deluxe at all.It&apos;s not convenient to take a taxi around the hotel, especially when commuting. There is no subway or bus, and there are no hotels around.The breakfast in the hotel is poor, the restaurant is small, there are many people to eat, and there are few things to eat.It&apos;s too close to the track. The train is shaking.I stayed for 5 days, and never mentioned checking out. Finally, Ctrip told me that I checked out after only staying for 2 days. Although it was solved in the end, I was very unhappy. The only good thing was that the staff of the hotel were quite enthusiastic	0
It&apos;s been a month since I bought this book, because there was a MBTI course before, and I didn&apos;t go because of the time.Later, I wanted to collect some information on this aspect on the Internet. Let&apos;s have a look at it first. I also read other people&apos;s comments before choosing it.Compared with the same MBTI book [talent difference], it is less professional, more practical and involves more work.People who want to apply MBTI can buy it for reference.It is suggested that we should combine it with the talent difference, and we will get more profits.	1
Hotel covers a large area, known as garden style.Living in the reception building, the conditions are very general, still clean.On the first floor, there is no broadband. It is said that only on the third and fourth floors.Because it was ordered in advance, when we arrived, we found that the bed we asked for had been added in advance, which was not bad.Considering that it is in Anqing, and the house price is also cheap, I don&apos;t care about everything.	1
Can afford the price of 3799, motherboard poor, so cheap, but there should be some, play general games can also be	1
Environment is good, indoor color is very warm, mm is very satisfied!It&apos;s just that the windows are too sloppy. I feel messy when I open the curtains.The most insufficient place is the shower, one is the place is too small, the second is the bath water when big and small, in the middle also stopped a few seconds!!	1
Before I finished work, I was ready to pick up the goods at noon yesterday. When I arrived at 13 pm yesterday, I was not ready. I waited for more than ten minutes to pick up the goods.	1
The big and frightening picture, adults feel some horror.I don&apos;t like it very much, neither does my son.Too old children, for example, feel too simple when they are over three years old. They only say one sentence when they are over three years old, which has little educational significance. However, they feel terrible when they are under three years old. I regret choosing this book.It really feels like this.	0
Cheap, good value for money.Breakfast: relatively monotonous.	1
It&apos;s a good hotel. I often stay in it. I&apos;m familiar with the surroundings and the hotel environment.	1
Read a novel, especially to commemorate the first love of reading, why care so much about the significance, as long as you see it, can think of their own once simple, persistent, desperate and the final escape is enough, and this book does.At the beginning, when Sun Jia meets Zhao Mei, there will be a slight smile floating on the corner of her mouth, a little trance unreal. Later, like many people, there will be tears falling gently. Since our unique unforgettable, let the author instead of us, aftertaste the initial move!	1
I suggest you book another hotel to avoid heartache, because this hotel is so bad in my opinion	0
"I picked up this book several times, and after reading only the ten agreements at the beginning, I couldn&apos;t read it any more. Tears filled my eyes every time.It&apos;s really a touching agreement. These ten agreements are not only the agreement between ""me"" and the dog, but also the desire and pursuit of love between relatives.Finally, I continued to read. The author&apos;s writing style was fresh and natural, as if a friend around me was telling his own story.The writing style of the translation is also very fluent. It can be seen that it is translated with emotion, so it is very infectious.It&apos;s a good book worth collecting. I&apos;ll read it to my baby in the future."	1
"This book was bought together with the ""don&apos;t call me English words book"". After receiving it, you can see the height of the single cover. Turning over the content and layout, this book is really too general. I can only say that I have no desire to read it all the time, and I haven&apos;t turned out 10 pages until now. Some of the contents are not professional, which is not worth reading"	0
In the ThinkPad brand, the cost performance is still high. I feel that the calorific value is a little high. Fortunately, the sound of the CD-ROM is loud when it is started, and 2G of memory is enough	1
There are HDMI and SD card readers. There are no bad points when you buy them. This is good.The packaging of Jingdong is also good, which can avoid the damage to the machine during transportation.On the whole, I am satisfied.	1
The people around them actually read the book one by one. When each of them introduced it to others, no one praised it. They just simply said: good-looking, have a look.Everyone chose silence after reading, even without a sigh, want to say something, but a mouth can only have a sigh.I think this is the power of a good book. It can immerse you in your heart. You feel shocked, but you can&apos;t discuss it in language. For the first time, you feel pale in language.It seems that everyone tacitly agrees to keep their own taste, which is enough.	1
I can&apos;t stand it. There are three cockroaches in total. As a four-star hotel, I&apos;m disappointed. Moreover, the Internet speed is too slow	0
I didn&apos;t want to see this book and bought it, which may be a kind of fate. (because I&apos;m in poor health, and I&apos;ve been in the hospital all the time. I&apos;ll try what others say. The content in the book is close to life, and food is easy to find. As long as I follow it, I believe my health will gradually get better.When you use something helpful to your body, please believe it, feel it and appreciate it. Your body will absorb it better.I believe that the health of the body in the future is the contribution of the book and the author. I hope more friends will be happy and healthy!	1
As soon as I received the book, I looked through it and felt that it was general. I felt that it had been processed in my own language with extracts from all kinds of traditional Chinese medicine books. Moreover, the writing was very rough, like talking casually, not like a book.Regret buying!I don&apos;t know what the author&apos;s job is, but as far as this book is concerned, it&apos;s very unprofessional. Maybe it&apos;s a writer&apos;s addiction to come up with some books that can be published by anyone!	0
The reason for buying this book is that the boss has been introduced to an investment company in Beijing, which can finance for us. Because of the simple procedures, large amount of financing and low interest, the boss is very happy.When the other party brought the financing information, it felt like a private equity fund, so he bought this book to see.It turns out that it is an unreliable transaction made by using people&apos;s mystique of private equity.Financing naturally failed, but a lot of knowledge, a very useful book.	1
It&apos;s too plastic. It&apos;s the same level as ASUS, Lenovo and HP.Think about ThinkPad, macbook and so on.	0
The hotel service consciousness is very poor, the restaurant can&apos;t sign the bill, it&apos;s afraid that the consumption is higher than the pre authorization.The waiters were obviously untrained.	0
The printing quality of the book is so poor that it feels like piracy.It&apos;s not the same quality as other books bought by Dangdang.Fortunately, the content is not fake.	0
I&apos;ve never spent 500 yuan to live in a room like this..... 1. Facing the light rail, I can&apos;t sleep in. 2. The sound insulation is not good. There seems to be a dance hall upstairs, which is very noisy. 3. The bed is very hard, very hard. 4. The room is very small. The most unbearable thing is that it&apos;s so hot in May in Shanghai. When I found that there is no air conditioning, I called the service and said: sorry, we are central air-conditioning. Now we haven&apos;t been informed to turn it on. If necessary,I asked the waiter to send you an electric fan... I didn&apos;t accept her suggestion, so it was muggy all night... I was very dissatisfied with this hotel	0
General content, too single!I don&apos;t think education is very profound. There are not many real life Liezi. It&apos;s meaningless!	0
Classic design, piano baking paint is very beautiful. It looks very comfortable! The machine performance is also very good, the speed is very fast!	1
It&apos;s a little troublesome to change XP system. There is no Acer Epower management power management software in the paid CD	0
The front door of the hotel is very fashionable, the hall is very personalized, and the rooms also maintain the same style. The green wood grain and masonry walls are simple and personalized, much like the Express Hotel.It&apos;s worth it in terms of price.	1
How to look at it? After a while, the story is not over, and then we talk about other things, and then we go on with the previous one.Sometimes it makes a mess for me. I have to see what I said before.Is the printing wrong?	0
The content of the book is good, that is, the corner of the book was slightly damaged when the book was delivered. The book was originally read on the Internet, but it was out of stock when I wanted to buy it. Now it&apos;s back on the market. Gu bought it to collect it for reading in her spare time. In fact, for a woman, it really made my eyes drop that a man could write such delicate words,It&apos;s not so grand, but it&apos;s heartwarming. As others say, in the end, there&apos;s silk, which gives people the feeling of unfinished, and there&apos;s always continuity. But the story can&apos;t be finished, but the book always has an ending. It&apos;s good	1
I live in a 350 bed room. By the four-star standard, the furniture is too old, the room is too small, and the breakfast is single. Generally speaking, everything else is OK. The location is good and the service is good	1
Toshiba&apos;s this is really good workmanship, this price, configuration is also good, in short, cost performance is OK.	1
Stay in this hotel: the software and hardware are better, the price is reasonable.But the parking garage can&apos;t directly enter the hotel. It&apos;s not very convenient to get out of the garage from the main door.But next time I come to Taiyuan, she is the first choice.	1
The price reduction is too fast. If you find it early, you&apos;ll have to wait a few days. It&apos;s only 500 in a month, and now you&apos;re sending wireless routers.Cry~~~	1
The only feeling is that the hard disk is divided into two drives, each more than 100 g, if it can be divided into three or more, ha ha	0
According to colleagues, all aspects are good, next business trip, they also hope to stay in this hotel	1
The appearance is the key. It&apos;s really good-looking. It&apos;s a bit IMAC style. But I don&apos;t know what kind of black has been rubbed on the machine I got. Fortunately, it can be wiped off. What&apos;s most depressing to me is that the score of y330 graphics card under vista is even higher than my Y430!You know, my 430 is the top model, P8400 CPU. I&apos;m depressed ~ ~ ~ I bought it for my girlfriend. She is very satisfied. I think it&apos;s good. I lost another 100 yuan in time. I&apos;m depressed~	1
Beautiful appearance, eye-catching white keyboard, reasonable function key settings; good keyboard material, solid touch; touch pad with bump processing, good hand feel, simple touch zoom function, more practical; p7450 is the best low-power processor of core 2 at present, 512MB graphics card plays games very well, very powerful, at the same time, the graphics card in this level is also relatively high-end; try it out,Under the condition of daily use, the battery can be used for 4 hours when it is fully charged at the balance setting; besides, the battery is not heavy, which gives consideration to both performance and weight	1
"I&apos;ve read a lot of books adapted into TV series, and I feel that books are better than TV. This time, it&apos;s an exception.Books and TV are as like as two peas. They are not written meticulously, and are somewhat disappointing.What&apos;s more, the change of Xu Sanduo is a little too big for people to accept. How can people who have performed so badly in all aspects before suddenly become ""far ahead"" after turning the horizontal bar?If it is said that he has caught up with others through his efforts, how can he suddenly surpass Shi Jin and others who were much better than him? Is everyone behind, or has he become a genius himself?I&apos;ve been a soldier myself. I&apos;ve seen a lot of hardworking people, but I haven&apos;t seen such a rapid progress."	0
The room is small but clean!A bit of home feeling, will live in the future!	1
It&apos;s a bad hotel. It&apos;s called a hotel. It&apos;s not good at all. The lobby is like a temporary one on one side. There are no security guards at the door. There are bicycles parked beside the windows. There&apos;s no sense of security.Hotel facilities are old, beds are small and difficult to sleep, pure water is not provided, boiling water is very hard to drink.The condition of the bathroom is not as good as a better hostel.It&apos;s bad to have a little breakfast.This is the worst star hotel I&apos;ve ever stayed in. It can&apos;t compare with an economical hotel.I don&apos;t know why Ctrip would recommend it.	0
The calorific value is also too big, just started not long, only the Internet, the machine is very hot, GPU has not been under 50 degrees, CP has been more than 44 degrees, I do not know whether it is normal or my this one has a problem, I hope someone can give me some advice~	0
It&apos;s five-star. The room is relatively small. There&apos;s still a problem with the network, but the service staff have a strong business ability, so they can get it done quickly	1
My twin son is five years old and they like it very much.When I read to them, they were quiet and attentive.In the middle, I was so moved that I couldn&apos;t go on reading, but the children didn&apos;t urge me. They just looked at me strangely and quietly waiting for me to continue reading. They just frowned and asked me with a heavy expression: is it dead?Seems to have become sensible?!	1
Originally I like this cartoon very much. The description is clearly written in Chinese and English bilingual dialogue and subtitles. There is no repetition.When you buy it back, you can see that there are still Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in it. There are no Chinese dialogues and subtitles. What&apos;s more, there are repetitions.It&apos;s very immoral.liar!	0
The room in Taihe building is not bad.The check-in and check-out time is too long.When checking in, please tell me that the room is not ready, but you can&apos;t check in and let the luggage in first (because you are in a hurry for other things).Later, after the room was ok, it took 40 minutes to check in.	0
First of all, I bought it after reading your comments. I admit I was cheated.The book is very thin. The paper of the book I bought for my child is much thicker than this one. This one is very small in my hand and has no texture.I read 15 books, which are less than 5cm thick.In addition, the binding is very poor. Every book is fixed with a stapler. It&apos;s very dangerous for children to read such a book. I&apos;ve cut my mouth by such a book before. Children are not so honest in reading, so I&apos;ll buy books without staples in the future.I&apos;ll buy it after you think about it. Don&apos;t read the reviews. It&apos;s very good. The price is not expensive. I&apos;ve bought it for a long time. I&apos;m just throwing away my books now. It&apos;s useless.	0
In the same kind of notebook, the configuration is more practical, the appearance is simple and generous, there is HDMI HD interface, the CPU-Z test memory is modern DDR2 800	1
In Ctrip hotel reservation so many times, encountered the worst hotel.I live in the Executive Deluxe room. I get up at 7:30 a.m. and I don&apos;t even have hot water to take a bath.Invoice said no invoice, please help Ctrip, do not put this hotel on your Internet harm.thank you!	0
My original s6130 is made in Malaysia. It has been used for several days. The system has good stability, excellent screen display effect and good battery time. How about three hours	1
Acer every machine is always attractive, there are gains and losses, this price to buy such a machine value, keyboard is good, feel good, typing is very comfortable	1
"The hotel is poor. I think it will be upgraded from two stars to three stars.The poor hardware is tolerable, but the poor front desk service is intolerable.The service at the front desk is very poor.A waitress named Zhang Hongmei had a very bad attitude.I have complained to the lobby manager verbally.I hope my brothers and sisters will not meet such a person next time.Supplementary comments December 2, 2007: the hotel is relatively poor, I estimate that there are two stars upgraded to three stars.The poor hardware is tolerable, but the poor front desk service is intolerable.The service at the front desk is very poor.A waitress named Zhang Hongmei had a very bad attitude.Even if I meet someone on the street, I have a better attitude than her. I arrived at the front desk in the evening, waiting for a long time (she has been working on the computer, I don&apos;t know what she is doing) and then impatiently told me what do you do?!!!!!I had to be very careful about lodging. Then I was very impatient to help me with the formalities. When I checked out, I met such a God. You can&apos;t imagine my bad attitude. It seems that I have a deep hatred with her. I have complained to the lobby manager verbally.I hope my brothers and sisters will not meet such a person next time.At the same time, I hope the hotel can give me a reply. Chunling219 ＠ sohu.com Hotel feedback December 10, 2007: regarding the situation you reflected, the room leaders attached great importance to it and immediately held a special meeting for the front desk staff and all the management staff to criticize, educate and retrain the staff concerned.Ensure that in the future work to improve service quality, establish a ""customer first"" service awareness, and strive to do a good job of customer service.We sincerely apologize to you again and look forward to your staying in Zhenjiang hotel again."	0
Just boot, the computer fan directly run, the outlet of the hot air has been whistling, scared, but after the installation of XP system.No XP driver ~ ~ ASUS should add it as soon as possible	0
Although there are teaching plan cases, I feel that it is not suitable for my education mode!Our experimental conditions are not so high, whether it is students or teachers do not pay enough attention to biology, it&apos;s OK, even if you don&apos;t read in the high school entrance examination, you can be hungry!I&apos;ve seen enough videos of good classroom classes. That&apos;s their school students in Beijing. They attach great importance to this aspect. Students will also be well prepared for biology learning. Experimental data and discussion can play a very good teaching effect and cooperation. However, this book is helpful for junior high school biology teachers!	1
If it wasn&apos;t for reading Eileen Chang&apos;s book more familiar, I would not have opened this man&apos;s book.If it wasn&apos;t for a more comfortable understanding of Eileen Chang, I would not have seen this man&apos;s views on Eileen Chang.So, I bought it just for others	0
"After reading the book living, I feel the fragility of life and the impermanence of the world.Although the hero Fugui has gone through tribulations, he never bows to fate, never complains about life, and continues to live with a tenacious attitude. This spirit is worth learning from everyone.As the book says: ""people live for the sake of living itself, not for anything other than living.""Therefore, no matter how much disaster and pain we encounter, we should choose to live bravely, perseveringly and tenaciously!Because it&apos;s good to be alive!"	1
It&apos;s very cost-effective, especially the special offer in 1999.The performance is enough for general use. Anyway, the Internet and a small amount of text processing are quite sufficient	1
I bought one before and gave it to my friends. After I got it, I liked it very much, so I ordered another one.The quality of the book is really good, but I don&apos;t know if it is damaged due to collision during transportation.We hope to strengthen the packing strength when we deliver the goods.	1
1Carpet is very dirty, utensils such as kettle and toilet are aging. 2. Service is very good. 3. Geothermal mineral water is very good	1
Dangdang net sent the wrong goods to me and refused to return the freight when refunding. It said that because the express company had already delivered the goods, I admit that the express company has provided services, but the mistake lies in Dangdang. Dangdangdang should bear the freight! It&apos;s too unreasonable, it&apos;s just robbing money!!!!!	0
To tell you the truth, I waited until the book with great expectation. I found that at most one third of the content in the book was about the method of curing diseases, and the rest was only the author&apos;s subjective metaphor, and then metaphor, and then reverie. It was very tedious, and it was obvious that I was gathering up a few pieces.grief...	0
Don&apos;t want to see, don&apos;t want to see, buy useless also. Just see feel a little interesting, but see more than once, feel connotation is not deep. Don&apos;t want to see	0
08I was very satisfied with the big bed room I stayed in in February 2003.It&apos;s really a five-star level, and the price was low at that time.I&apos;ll go again next time I get a chance.	1
Compared with m853, it has less HDMI, camera, piano and keyboard, and its hard disk is smaller (160g).The price is only 300 yuan less than 853!There&apos;s no reason to choose it except color.	0
My baby is nearly two years old. This set of books is too simple and unattractive for her. I bought it after reading everyone&apos;s comments, which is not ideal.	0
Cost effective, in addition to the integrated graphics card, other very good, do not play the game is absolutely no problem.I think we can only make the best use of XP. I will work hard in the process of installing XP, and it will be easy to do after making a backup.	1
Overall, I feel pretty good. I will live here next time. I forget the hotpot on the floor. I recommend it	1
It&apos;s a big book with little content and few words.For younger children, the folio is too big and hard.Older children see too little content	0
"When I got it, my chin was about to fall off: This is not a book. It&apos;s a pamphlet.The author is not so kind.But after reading the content, I think the price is very cheap.If you only buy it as a novel from the perspective of consumption, you will regret it. I advise you to buy other books.If you want to learn the skills of ultra short-term trading from the perspective of investment, then this pamphlet is absolutely valuable.It&apos;s equivalent to 50 cents to buy the martial arts secret book ""Tathagata palm"". It&apos;s true ""Tathagata palm"" without any deception."	1
It&apos;s a good location. It&apos;s in the center of Xujiahui, Shanghai. The cost performance is average. The room is relatively large	1
The decoration of the hotel is relatively old.The water in the bathroom of my room is very small, so it&apos;s inconvenient to take a bath.	0
When I first saw this novel, I was looking forward to it. When I was really reading it, I didn&apos;t catch my attention at first, but I gradually realized the bitterness of it. Especially in the last chapter 10, I was tearful when I read it. I&apos;m really sad. I don&apos;t know how the author felt when I was writing. If it was, I would give up writing, because it was so sad.After reading it, I suddenly had the idea that I would not read the sad sketches in the future. I was really sad, but it indirectly showed the strength of shuiyueying&apos;s writing.Come on, support you!	1
"Although the content of this book is not much, the illustrations are very large, vivid and vivid. The stories in it are all things that children have encountered, and they are very enlightening. My daughter likes it very much after reading it, and when she comes across similar things in the operation, she will say ""David, no way"". Oh, it seems that it is influenced by subtle influence. Generally speaking, I think this book is good,No wonder it&apos;s a prize winning book."	0
This is a perfect book!It&apos;s like seeing myself when I see Lala. I&apos;m also a sales assistant and executive director now, so when I read this book, I regard Lala as myself. The inner feelings of the characters are surprisingly similar to mine, so I can better understand the feelings of the protagonist Lala and her actions.I was also confused, it was Lala who gave me the motivation to move forward!As a newcomer to the society, I am always sentimental and straightforward. I should constantly learn from social experience, behave well and make continuous progress.Many of the principles in the book are very practical, and sometimes I will deliberately ask myself how to do it.Sometimes I will complain, because it seems that I am the busiest in the company, but my salary is still the lowest.Lala is my example, and my industry example, I want to progress, as long as I work hard, I will progress!Du Lala&apos;s promotion is a good book worth reading!	0
The price is moderate. Overall, I think it&apos;s OK.It&apos;s a little difficult to find the location (because it&apos;s not near the main road), but it&apos;s very close to Beijing Road, the commercial street, and there&apos;s a small food street outside the hotel.	1
CF card and wireless network card (non USB) can not be inserted into the computer to use; vista system is not happy, want to modify WinXP;	0
DDR3 is a waste of memory, and upgrading memory is also very expensive.There are all the drivers in the CD, that is, you have to find the corresponding one by yourself. If you find the wrong one, it&apos;s easy to have a blue screen.	0
What type of physical fitness is, how to keep fit, read this book let me find the direction at once.In the past, my eating habits were not reasonable, with more meat and less fruits and vegetables. For a long time, I got constipation, which was very painful.For this reason, I have read a lot of health books, but the pertinence is not strong enough.According to the suggestions in the book, taking a single Chinese patent medicine, the book pays attention to individual differences. It has a quick effect and does not produce the side effects of taking cathartic medicine.Very thorough analysis of the constitution, only found this one, solemnly recommended.	1
The CD-ROM drive is like an engine. It&apos;s very loud. It&apos;s hard to install the system. XP can&apos;t find a driver at all. It&apos;s very calorific,	0
"Light and thin are absolutely satisfactory. From the point of view of workmanship, it seems that it can continue the quality of old IBM.The heat dissipation is much better than expected. I thought it would be very hot if such a thin thing was used continuously.The speed is also very good, but the reminder that vista often asks you to confirm whether to ""continue"" is annoying."	1
Maybe it&apos;s because of the different national conditions, or maybe it&apos;s because of the high expectation of this book, so I feel very twisted after rough reading the content. There are too many dogmas!Strong theory!	0
Little Japanese style, small figure painting, it looks hard, the content is not nutritious, a book takes 1 hour to finish!	0
The big bed room is very good. The most recommended ones are the swimming pool and free long-distance telephone. The disadvantages are that the lobby is too small and the taxi at the door. As long as you go to the airport, you must ask for more money. It&apos;s only 74 yuan when you come from the airport and 100 yuan when you go to the airport. You don&apos;t have time to argue with him	1
I bought it for someone else.After I got the book, I had a cursory look and thought it was very good.The first part is a very basic dialogue exercise, followed by cloze and reading comprehension exercises, and the last part is reading common proverbs and idioms.The content is relatively simple, suitable for students who have poor foundation but want to improve their reading ability, or junior self-study.If we can make good use of this book, it will help to improve our reading ability.Suggestion: if only there is an improved version, let the students continue to improve their ability after learning this book.	1
It took less than a week from getting the book to reading it last night.I have begun to use the methods described in the book to change my daily life.Although I know that it will take me a long time to achieve that kind of balance, I feel much more peaceful and positive than before.It made me understand that if you make yourself happy from your heart, no one can take away this feeling, no matter how things around you change.I will recommend this book to my dear friends and family. May we all live in love, joy and hope.Definitely, I will.	1
The appearance is fashionable, bright, exquisite and impeccable. The system has a lot of new software. I like movie story best. I can edit videos and movie clips by myself. There are many new functions to be found~~	1
Looking forward to 2 weeks, I finally got the copy. As soon as I turned it on, the screen didn&apos;t light up. I ran back to the headquarters to return the machine. Now I&apos;m still waiting for the test. I said I&apos;ll wait 15 working days. Hehe, is it easy to buy a computer?Can you afford to waste time?Excuse me?	0
Small size, easy to carry, little heat, battery standby time is longer than ordinary notebook, but shorter than advertising time, 4-5 hours is OK.	1
The cost performance is good. I live in the business room of Donghui building, and the breakfast is also good. The doorman is not very active. The deposit is the highest in the hotel I have stayed in. The lobby supervisor is very good. Now I don&apos;t have enough. The password of the card is wrong, which leads to the insufficient deposit. The supervisor signs for me, which is very comfortable	1
4My son is a dinosaur fan.When I bought the book, I saw so many kinds of dinosaur names, and I felt that the content seemed very rich.But after I got the books, I found that they were not very thick.Although not in the form of stories, but in the form of popular science, my son still likes it very much.After two months of continuous reading, basically now just turn to the first page and you can point to the head of each dinosaur and say its name.Even the distribution of dinosaur fossils on the earth, the age of dinosaurs, and so on, are of great interest.It can only be said that children have children&apos;s vision, and adults&apos; vision is not necessarily suitable for children.	1
[recommendation] probably many middle school students, even college students and adults are full of curiosity about our world and universe.So this book is a good choice for you.Based on the basic knowledge of high school, in simple terms, you can satisfy your curiosity without feeling a lot of inferiority and irritability.At the same time, it also enables us to expand our knowledge, so we have another topic in front of our friends - so that you will not be an outsider when talking about such problems.	1
"During the Qingming holiday, my family of three happily checked in through Ctrip. I wanted to have a luxurious self driving tour, but the room I was given was pitifully small. Compared with the environment of four-star hotels at home and abroad, the environment was ""bad""!When I checked in at the front desk, the staff told me that breakfast for children under 1.2 meters was free, so I made up for an adult&apos;s breakfast. When I had breakfast the next day, the manager of the restaurant told me that children should pay half the price, and that it was the full price of external charges!Finally, after some negotiation, the hotel lobby manager gave us a discount of 8, but it has made our family no fun!The room environment of the hotel is not worth four-star level at all!The decoration is old, the room is small, but the location of the hotel is good, so can we set such a high price?to be puzzled!Supplementary comments April 23, 2008: by the way, the Internet is actually charged, which is the first time in China!it is beyond logic and above reason!"	0
"I bought Bi Shumin&apos;s ""female psychologist"" with great expectation. Before reading this work, I was full of expectation, because I have read a lot of Bi Shumin&apos;s works.I really like the story after story she told in plain, philosophical and concise language, especially the woman worker I read in 2008. I have read it many times in a row and I like it very much.To tell you the truth, I feel a little disappointed after reading the female psychologist.Although I am a science student, I like reading very much.Horton, the protagonist of this work, is a man who is not only humble but also intelligent and has a certain pursuit.In constant efforts to obtain the qualification of psychological counselors, in order to open a clinic, married a kind-hearted but no feelings of men.I don&apos;t know what such a heroine brings to readers?At the same time, a few stories in the works are far away from daily life. When I look at them, I feel that the author is writing purely for the sake of writing, which is worthless. Except for a few words that leave some impression on me, I forget the rest after reading the book.What a disappointment!"	0
The room is ordinary. The water in the bathroom and bathtub can&apos;t go down. The standard room opens the window to the dining hall. It seems that there are still people dining and playing music at 12 pm. It&apos;s very noisy	0
The location of the hotel is very good. It has just been redecorated, so the facilities are passable. There are computers in the room I ordered, and the Internet speed is good.It&apos;s just that there are black marks on the mat in the bathtub, which makes people feel bad.Breakfast is very rich, but it seems that the breakfast in hotels in Chongqing is very similar.Overall, I feel good!	1
In fact, the things used by big brands are not very different from those used by small factories. What they buy are quality control system and after-sales service, especially notebook computers.General Internet access and file processing, to see what the photos are enough, blindly high requirements, configuration is not interesting, with two years and then change new.	1
The price performance is good. In fact, I have been paying attention to Dell&apos;s xps1330, but the price performance is not good, so I hesitated to buy it.Fortunately, I didn&apos;t buy it.	1
I live in room 241. It&apos;s quiet. The sputum is very old and there are a lot of hair on it. Breakfast is very simple and poor. I think the level of more than 200 hotels can make do with it. Even the taste of milk is very weak. Except for oranges and small tomatoes, there are no fruits. Moreover, we have to go to the front desk every morning to get food coupons. This is also very outrageous. Even if we don&apos;t get bored, we also increase the workload of the front desk. In addition, there are always people checking out in the morningOriginally, it was a good thing to send bottled water to the room, but the quality of the water was really poor. First, the bottles blackened, and the blackening degree of each bottle was different. When the bottle was not opened, it was very soft to pinch. Obviously, it was made of recycled raw materials (illegal) (I&apos;m a plastic material worker, so I dare say that the water also had a strange smell,This is too much. Although some of the previous comments say that the price is suitable for the quality, I would like to say that if you look carefully, there are many hotels in Beijing with lower price and better quality	0
Good BL text, no touching lingering, two cool thin men looking for warmth in each other&apos;s close, but maintain the appropriate calculation and distance.Isn&apos;t that what human nature is?I think there is nothing wrong with it. People should love themselves before they can love others.In the final analysis, love is nothing more than human feelings. How can a person who doesn&apos;t love himself love others?Jin Chen and Xiao Zhihao are also in the entertainment industry, which makes people less concerned about their homosexual identity. Tolerance also needs environment.	1
"When I saw the article ""tears are the only criterion for testing literature"" on the southern weekend, I have to admit that I was a petty bourgeois at that time, and the author was sensational. Look at that topic.The story is a common routine in novels, movies and TV. The plot of love and death, blood suspicion under the background of the cultural revolution is even simpler. The possible difference is that the tragic death is a male compatriot, Laosan.A series of celebrities who despise the recommendation on the back cover of this book.Fortunately, after reading a rather interesting workplace novel, Du Lala&apos;s promotion, it made this life like life."	0
Amd dual core CPU, 250g hard disk, with camera, economical.USB distribution is also reasonable.Can install XP, good	1
Good friend recommended, originally was to give online links, but I am still more used to the traditional reading mode.So I bought it. It&apos;s very touching, especially when I saw that Ruan Zhengdong was so kind to Jiaqi and understood her so well, and quietly helped her find her home, I criedAlthough, the ending is not perfect, but their attitude towards love, so wholeheartedly love a person, is the greatest interpretation of true love.Recently, many of my friends broke up inexplicably, which made me confused.After seeing it, I strengthened my confidence in love and decided to cherish the people around me.	1
The book is not very good, the price is expensive, I feel cheated, especially the paper is too bad, my friends suspect that it is pirated. Go to the bookstore before the next online shopping	0
The hotel may not have a smoke-free room at all, but Ctrip has nothing to do with it. It&apos;s dereliction of duty to talk about it first. The facilities are dilapidated, the towels are yellow, the bed sheets and quilt covers are old, I don&apos;t know if they have been changed. The service staff are all of them	0
I thought this set of books was a little simple for my 6-year-old daughter. I&apos;m afraid she won&apos;t be interested in it.I didn&apos;t expect to be loved by my daughter.When I have finished reading each book, she has to read it again carefully (mainly looking at the pictures).And role play with me, self styled as Tiao Tiao, mom is Tiao Tiao.The picture of the book is simple, but there are many interesting and vivid details; the content of the story is simple, but it contains a memorable philosophy and warmth.I think the age level should be wide.And the cost performance is also relatively high.	1
The cooling system is 3 hours worse than before. When I went to Jingdong, I said that the inspection was delayed for 15 three guarantee days, and I couldn&apos;t get to AQSIQ.The display is also poor.When you meet a defective product, you are speechless.	0
Booking is recommended by Miss Ctrip, how to say, one word, rotten, two words, really rotten, three words, really rotten.Typical traces of state-owned government units don&apos;t know what service is. The rooms are small and dilapidated, and Samsung is reluctant.Spent more than 400 to buy a bottle of red wine, rancid!	0
JD&apos;s delivery speed is really much faster than before. After the payment was made at more than five o&apos;clock that night, the goods were delivered in an hour after the meeting&apos;s confirmation, and Shentong express delivered the next day. ASUS notebook is really good to use. It takes only a few minutes to install XP with the CD-ROM drive. After the hard disk partition, I installed win7 again, which is very cool to use. I added 2G of memory, and the machine can recognize it	1
It&apos;s very cost-effective and the service is very good. If you have a room, you can delay the check-out. It&apos;s very beneficial for the tourists who leave Hong Kong by night flight. I just hope that the breakfast charge can be the same as Ctrip, and the buffet of 80 yuan is still attractive. In addition, it&apos;s too expensive to take the Guangzhou Kowloon East Railway, so it&apos;s recommended to take the Jinzhong subway	1
The configuration is quite good..Graphics card is the selling point..The box says NBA collection..Memory is two 1g..It&apos;s easy to install XP..There are drivers available on official websites..	1
It&apos;s OK on the whole, but it&apos;s not equipped with the system. It&apos;s not convenient to install XP system. I changed several systems.Ha ha	1
1.The screen size could have been larger, and the LCD size was much smaller than the top cover size; 2. The built-in software has an easy display manager. After it is forbidden to run, the functions of FN + brightness adjustment and closing the wireless network will be invalid.I hope this can give the new brother a reminder	0
My mother&apos;s health is not very good, and she also pays attention to health preservation. She often watches TV about this content. However, due to the habit of thrift, she never buys books to read, and I often don&apos;t have a side. In order to help her protect her body more effectively, she buys them for her. Moreover, the price of Dangdang online is relatively happy. The books are all genuine books, and mother receives a very high priceXing, in the absence of relevant TV programs, reading these books has become the main content of her spare time life.There will be more of them.	1
9/11Due to business trip, the hotel is too bad. The worst thing is the hotel environment. There is no shop or hotel nearby, and there is a non operating railway station nearby. The road is covered with dust, and there are donkey carts passing by from time to time. Judging from the interior decoration of the hotel, it was not opened in 2006 at all. At least it has been opened for more than 10 years. The carpet is dirty. There is no independent shower room in the bathroom. Just pull the shower curtain and wash waterThe first day&apos;s bath water was very cold, and the water temperature was about 30 degrees. The crickets in my colleagues&apos; room called for two nights, and the breakfast included in the room fee was even worse. There were only about six or seven varieties. We couldn&apos;t find a few grains of rice in the porridge, so we had to drink porridge soup. The rest of the things were cold (we didn&apos;t get up late, we had breakfast at 7:30)I want to eat a small steamed bread. It&apos;s very cold. Another of my colleagues took a plate and put it back. It&apos;s so bad that I don&apos;t want to eat it.It can be said that the only thing that this hotel can do is service.	0
The room is spacious, and there is a big gap between the lobby and the 5-star hotel.The speed of the elevator is fast, especially to the high level.	1
The front desk service is very poor: it&apos;s a viewing room.But on the first day of check-in, the front desk staff insisted that what I ordered was a suite, and I had to call Ctrip to confirm, then they said that what I ordered was a viewing room.When checking out, I found that the front desk staff changed the house price I confirmed at that time, changing the house price from 558 to 588, and this process has never been confirmed with me.What&apos;s more ridiculous is that the receptionist didn&apos;t even call me to confirm the water bill, so she went to swipe my card.I wonder if it&apos;s a black shop.Room service: originally, I wanted to sleep in. I was woken up by the phone at 9 a.m. and asked when I got up to clean up.I said I didn&apos;t wake up, but I was asked if I could wake up in an hour?Room: it&apos;s said to be the best hotel on the island, but the room is old and small.It&apos;s not as good as a Samsung hotel.	0
The sound is a little bad. The battery is not used, and it&apos;s gone for more than an hour.CPU temperature has been above 50 degrees, I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on	0

The screen size is smaller than hp14 inch; the keyboard is easy to get gray, so it is recommended that JD send the keyboard film; the refresh rate of the camera seems not high, and the total flash.I downloaded all the drivers from the official website, installed them all, and found that there are three PCI unknown devices, which is very depressing. Who can tell me what this is?	0
Good performance. The driver disk doesn&apos;t support XP. It&apos;s hard to install XP with the driver wizard and manual search driver. However, the machine is full and fast, and the screen is large. It&apos;s great to play games.	1
Good performance. The configuration is above average, which is enough for most users.The appearance is low-key, and it&apos;s good to buy a desktop at home.The screen is big, and it&apos;s very comfortable for middle-aged and old people to surf the Internet at home.	1
To tell the truth, this book is not very useful. What it tells won&apos;t make me feel that I have learned anything.It&apos;s just some places that are wrongly used in daily life. Just search the Internet.	0
Customers are required to mail books to Beijing. The postage alone is equivalent to the cost of books. Is it necessary to change them? Is it better to buy a new one? Your service is very disappointing.	0
There are too few accessories. I bought a high configuration version. It&apos;s a mainframe, a power supply and a big one. It&apos;s gone.There is no mouse, inner bag, not to mention outsourcing, cloth also don&apos;t think, should be equipped with a standard electricity.	0
Beautiful, good quality, and independent graphics card, very good for students.It&apos;s really suitable for my sister who goes to school. If there is a red one, it would be better.If you don&apos;t need to display it alone, the cost of the same mold display will be more valuable.	1
Living in a complex society, it is inevitable to encounter a variety of different situations.Only when we fully understand ourselves can we be at ease in it.After reading this book, I have benefited a lot and found more ways to make myself happy and grow up.I understand that many of the unhappiness in life is actually caused by myself.I also introduced this book to my confidant, who also felt very perceptive.We also found more resonance with each other.	1
I read the short letter to Garcia in my spare time.This book takes a historical story as the background, and leads to the simple truth about people, being people and doing things. Although the truth is simple and easy to understand, not everyone can understand and use it. The successful people are few, and the talents who can really understand the rules of success are wise.This book guides the direction and provides a shortcut for those who want to go and are ready to go to the road of success.It&apos;s easy to read but not easy to do. People in politics and business are good books that benefit their whole lives.	1
Breakfast was very poor, and the check-in service was also poor. I ordered a non-smoking big bed. When I entered the room, I found that it was a room with two beds. I asked them to change it. I found that it was a big bed, but it was a smoking room. Oh, I&apos;ll make do with it.It was found that there was a big depression on the bottom of the mattress, which was definitely inferior.	0
Yu Dan&apos;s experience has been seen on TV and on the Internet. I remember when I was in University, my teacher showed it to us. Now I bought a book when I saw it. It&apos;s very good to look through it. There are also bookmarks. The printing is color, which is also very good.	0
14The 4-inch wide screen is a little smaller, which is lower than the previous 4:3 screen utilization rate. However, the resolution has been improved, which can make up for it. That is, the words appear lower	0
It&apos;s cost-effective. I found a lot of shopping malls, but I didn&apos;t find a suitable one. The same thing is very expensive in other places.	1
She is a lazy guy. She disguises herself as a man and fish in troubled waters. She becomes the second child of the ghost horse shop in a mysterious restaurant. She meets the romantic and elegant young lady.Look at the little girl, how to play in the crowd of handsome menThe owner of the restaurant is a mysterious gentleman, which is not in accordance with her natural eight charactersIn the novel, there are many handsome men, lots of fun, and the plot is tortuous and compact.Starting point: Lin Jiacheng, the most popular contract writer on Chinese. Com, is another great work after fox drama!	1
1. Room service attitude is good. 2. Breakfast is pretty good. 3. The lighting of the room is not satisfactory~~	0
Especially about her and director comrades of the emotional line has been inseparable from the shadow of Qiongyao, too wishful thinking, I feel very good	0
Dangdang&apos;s delivery was really slow. It took eight days from placing the order to receiving it, but it was still express delivery. Moreover, I made at least 10 phone calls to express delivery, and it took several days to deliver it in the city. First of all, I said it was raining, but later, I always said that no one tried to arrange it.I bought more than 20 books, including a set of 12 books, which cost a few yuan each. But I sent one wrong book, one repeated book, and one didn&apos;t send it. I called Dangdang and said that if I wanted to change it, I would remit the whole set to the post office, and then exchange it for me. However, I really don&apos;t want to be so troublesome, and I have to wait for more than 10 days.This transaction exposed many problems of Dangdang.All in all, the deal was unpleasant.	0
The book is very good-looking. It has the characteristics of a child. Instead of telling stories blindly, it has a pause, which can leave children a lot of time to think.	1
"Let&apos;s talk about the hardware facilities first.I live in a 480 yuan economy suite. When I make the reservation, I indicate that I want a non-smoking room.When I stayed in room 1109, I got to know what a suite is. The room was very dark and small, the furniture was very old, and the carpet was very dirty.In particular, the smell of smoke in the room was very pungent and unbearable. I immediately asked the front desk to help me change my room.But the service staff said to come to the room first to confirm. OK, I&apos;ll wait.The waiter came, stood at the door and said, ""there&apos;s a smell, but I think it&apos;s wood.""Hehe, you can smell the strange smell without entering the room. You can imagine how big the smell is!It&apos;s not new decoration, it&apos;s not special wood, where&apos;s the smell of wood?I insist on changing rooms.So change to the same room 409, no taste, OK.The waiter showed me the room and helped me put my luggage. Then I went out.The waiter closed the door for me.When I came back in the evening, I found that the door couldn&apos;t be opened!The card was right, the lock was opened, but the door just couldn&apos;t be pushed open, but after a kick, it finally opened.Enter the door, and worry, the door can&apos;t close!After a careful look, I realized that it was too tight with the doorframe, so I kicked it again.The next morning, it took nine cows and two tigers to open the door.The bathroom is also very old, the towel is very old, it&apos;s gray.As soon as you turn on the cold water tap of the washbasin, it will make a loud noise like an engine, which makes you turn off immediately.Talking about service, I stayed alone, but I gave two breakfast tickets.Breakfast ends at 10 o&apos;clock, but at 9 o&apos;clock there are no more varieties.There are few varieties.On the table is a pair of chopsticks and a spoon, no knife and fork, very inconvenient.When I checked out, I gave the rest of the meal ticket back to the front desk. At the same time, the lobby manager came to inquire about the check-in situation, and I said that it was OK to give the meal ticket according to the number of people.The lobby manager said wrongly, ""you live in a big bed room. We&apos;ll give you two tickets.This is our service.I can&apos;t react to it all of a sudden, but when I contacted the inexplicable charging adult program in my room, I suddenly realized.Unfortunately, I&apos;m here on business, not for entertainment.Supplementary comments August 3, 2008: it can only be said that the enthusiasm of the service staff can be given high marks, but the service level is very average, and the facilities in the room are too poor.There was no small refrigerator in the room. What they provided was not bottled water, but bottled water. They didn&apos;t dare to drink.I made up my mind to book this hotel after reading your comments, but I was so disappointed that I doubted how these high marks came out.Hotel feedback August 13, 2008: Dear Sir: (please allow us to address you like this, because your name at the time of check-in is inconsistent with the feedback name of the guest).Thank you very much for your message and valuable advice to the hotel.As for all kinds of hardware problems you pointed out, the hotel has plans to decorate the guest rooms and related facilities by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the problems in hotel services have aroused the high attention of the hotel senior management. The hotel will conduct a thorough investigation on the matter and deal with the relevant staff accordingly. At the same time, the hotel will train the staff in all aspects,We hope to provide you with better service next time.We have saved your information in the customer history, and we will provide personalized service when we check in next time.Finally, thank you again for your suggestions, so that we can better serve our guests and improve the overall service quality."	0
I&apos;ll be objective. Let&apos;s refer to it.1. Hotel telephone can&apos;t call outside line, why doesn&apos;t Ctrip explain?2. Slippers are not disposable. 3. If you buy something small, it can&apos;t be included in the room fee. You have to pay separately.4. The socket in my room fell outside. Isn&apos;t it too unsafe.5. The most important service attitude is the attitude of the guest house.6. You can&apos;t check out if you feel dissatisfied.22 January 2008: 7. Breakfast is served at 7:30, a little late. Hotel feedback 16 August 2008: Thank you for your comments. We have reflected the significance and suggestions to our superior leaders, and improved the service. I hope you will really appreciate our progress when you check in next time.	0
Open the package, found that the battery has been installed on the machine, and there is no way to install the CD, I would like to ask whether this is the case?The ASUS laptop I bought last month, the battery is not on the machine.	0
I don&apos;t know why some of the comments are good. 1. The hotel is very old, and the room has a musty smell. I complained to the front desk. The front desk actually said that every room is like this. When it comes to getting angry, I adjusted the room, but the situation is only slightly better, and it&apos;s still a musty smell. 2. The room facilities are not good, and the air conditioner suddenly loses its function until midnight. It&apos;s not cold at all, and it&apos;s stuffy all night,The lower floor of the hotel is the office building, the elevator is shared, and the speed is very slow, which is a waste of time. 4. The security of the parking lot is very poor, and we don&apos;t want to open the fence on rainy days, so that the car can get close to the door of the hotel, and the service is very poor. Hotel feedback July 3, 2008: dear guests: Hello!We are sorry to learn about your unpleasant experience in the hotel. Please accept the most sincere apology from the hotel.Thank you for your valuable advice. The hotel leaders attach great importance to it. A special meeting has been held to find problems and implement improvement. We will continue to improve our management and improve the service quality to ensure that every guest can feel at home.Thank you for your support and look forward to your coming again!	0
I strongly demand that Jingdong change logistics. EMS express delivery is too slow. It took five working days to get it. A word is slow. If the machine is running, I haven&apos;t found anything wrong. It&apos;s just that the system is too difficult. I hope it can be improved	0
There are too few USB interfaces, only two, and they are all in the lower right corner of the fuselage. If you connect a USB mouse, it will be very inconvenient - of course, it would be better to switch to a Bluetooth mouse.	0
After reading this book, I have a feeling.Western booksellers sell services, while Chinese publishers sell goods.You can download the scale of this book directly from the Internet, and it can be used in actual combat immediately. However, in our Chinese books, even the contents of the book have to be omitted, which makes you unable to learn.We always say that in line with the world, the price of books is almost the same, but the service is still far from satisfactory.Now it&apos;s probably in line with Africa.Although this book is written by foreigners, we can also use it.Just pay attention to the differences in cultural background.	1
"Linyuan envies fish, it is better to retreat and form a net.Based on the in-depth analysis of the operation of 30 day average, MACD, trend line, CCI, brin line and other index lines, the paper analyzes one by one the operation strategies of ""judging the market trend with index stocks"", ""how to correctly use long short fight"", ""how to chase down and kill up"", ""t + 0 turnaround trading"", as well as the operation strategies under the influence of good and bad, and has a peaceful attitude to face the market, not to rise or notTo fall sad, inadvertently, you and I will harvest a lot of happiness!!Mr. Xu, after reading your book, I feel that my investment in the stock market has been improved. Thank you!"	1
When can receive, really can&apos;t, return I order again, deliver to the door good. Send others birthday book, birthday has passed, the book hasn&apos;t come yet	0
Help a friend order, feedback said not good!So I won&apos;t book this hotel next time!	0
Without any advantages, the price is high and the quality is not good. If you need a negative case, you can use it as a sample.	1
"I bought this book for Bi Shumin&apos;s fame, and for the slightly mysterious and mysterious words like ""woman"" and ""psychologist"". What happened?First of all, the writing style is very good, which needs to be praised.However, there is no innovation in the technique. It&apos;s nothing new to use the fashionable mode of writing in recent years!What I hate most is that the brief introduction contains the words of the patients and the titles of the contents that are not directly related to the main idea of each chapter.curry favour by claptrap!In the aspect of characters, their personalities are not outstanding.In particular, the highest authority in the field of psychology, how powerful it is, has its origin, but there is no personality or depth in the dialogue. It&apos;s just a layman.Women&apos;s psychological life experience is too vulgar to be vulgar any more. Even big s plays have similar plots.Her personality development also appeared fault, especially from nursing home to psychology, the change is far fetched.The other characters have no impression after reading.Everyone feels it&apos;s not worth wasting time!"	0
After a rough review, my colleagues also borrowed it to have a look. Our feeling is that this book is messy and hard to read.Moreover, the description in it is rather rough, not very practical and meaningless.	0
Because of the need of meeting customers, I only stayed once. Because I used to live in 5 stars and they were very new, I didn&apos;t feel so good this time. Many aspects still need to be improved	1
Full of longing to see this book, to see the final, not as shocking as imagined, so tearful.The author&apos;s writing style is very poor and elementary. The narration can&apos;t produce emotional resonance. I suggest that he learn more about those famous works and write about the Cultural Revolution as well. Please see how Yu Hua writes about love and how aunt Qiongyao describes it. I also think that the purest love in history is not worthy of the name.Amy, do you think it&apos;s pure to describe the hero and heroine without any relationship????It seems that your understanding of love is too shallow	0
It would be perfect to bring Bluetooth and camera.But the price went up.Just bought a week and fell 200 yuan, uncomfortable.	0
Don&apos;t want to see, don&apos;t want to see, buy useless also. Just see feel a little interesting, but see more than once, feel connotation is not deep. Don&apos;t want to see	0
The battery is strong, and it can meet the needs of Internet office. The keyboard is relatively large. It&apos;s very useful after switching to XP	1
It&apos;s cost-effective, and the quality is also good. There&apos;s no difficulty in installing the system. Just drive to the pipe network to find it. It can be done in 1 hour ~ ha ha ~ the cool base is not easy to connect~	1
My baby boy, Xu 4 years old, doesn&apos;t like this series of books very much. Maybe it&apos;s because of the cultural differences between the East and the west, and the story plot. As an adult, I feel that I can&apos;t accept it.Like a chicken with teeth	0
26The order was not delivered until the 30th due to waiting for rapoo&apos;s mouse. However, unexpectedly, the price was reduced on the same day, and the price guarantee was 44 yuan, which was an extra gain. XP system didn&apos;t work much, but the wireless network card was unstable, so it seemed that the driver could be reloaded. The promotion was n network card. Unfortunately, the home route was 54, and the speed of 108 was not verified,It has been upgraded to 10.5.7, and the problem of headphones hasn&apos;t been solved yet. The battery is 5200ma, which can&apos;t last for 5 hours	1
Generally speaking, the impression of Dengfeng is relatively poor, which is basically a typical example of dirty and poor!The facilities of the hotel are extremely simple, there is no shower curtain in the bathroom, and the room is full of water!Besides, there is no place to hang clothes.The restaurant in the hotel was out of light before 7 o&apos;clock.In a word, it&apos;s a dark and old hotel. The conditions are very general.However, the location is good, opposite the supermarket, there is a snack street.	0
The location of the hotel is good, the quality of the room is also very good, but the parking space is a little less, and the parking is a little nervous.But it&apos;s understandable, because it&apos;s in the center of Nanjing.	1
I doubt the evaluation standard of five star hotel.Samsung is not as good as all, very disappointed!	0
"Mr. Ma Weidu, who is famous for his collection in CCTV&apos;s ""forum of 100 schools"", selected some Xu Xiaowen from his blog and introduced some of his collections, so he had this set of ""Ma Weidu&apos;s talk"".The small book is exquisitely printed, so people can&apos;t put it down.The article is based on blog, mostly for the perception of life and the recollection of the past.We see a more three-dimensional and lively collection.What Ma Weidu pays attention to is not only the collection and culture, but also the concern and expectation of the country and society.This life experience of most of my life is perhaps more valuable than the collection experience."	1
I don&apos;t know what happened recently. I have published a lot of books about the harem, which makes me depressed.I have been paying attention to this book of Daxin for a long time. When I saw it on the shelf, I ordered it immediately. Fortunately, it was delivered the next day.At 4 a.m., I had to squint for several hours in order to go to work with my eyes open.In a word, it&apos;s so good-looking, how can it be so good-looking!I&apos;ve been watching the NP ending of Daxin. Maybe it&apos;s for publication this time, but I&apos;m sorry.After reading the color of Daxin, I feel it&apos;s incomparable. I really hope it can be published!	1
I&apos;ve seen a lot of comments again. Please, don&apos;t be so impulsive and calm down.	1
I think many books are better than this book. I bought it only when I saw the ranking of the ranking list. There is no content at all. The story is too bullshit and I don&apos;t like it	0
The hotel equipment is old and the service is poor, which is not as good as the two-star standard. What&apos;s more depressing is that I got off the train at 7:30 in the morning and arrived at the hotel, but I was told that I would not be able to stay until 9:00, otherwise I would have to add half a day&apos;s rent.As a result, in order to avoid freezing, he paid 250 yuan more.As a result, Ctrip is not my score.It&apos;s a real injustice.	0
High cost performance, good performance, XP is easy to install, everything is done with a U disk version of winpe, no command line to rebuild MBR	1
There is no breakfast, the hotel price is more expensive, the room equipment is relatively old.But it&apos;s nice to have a swimming pool!Japanese cuisine and Brazilian barbecue buffet on the second floor are not bad!	1
It looks beautiful, the keyboard is very handsome, and the handle is very good. I&apos;ve been using it for several days, except that the shortcut key on the top didn&apos;t respond, the others are OK, and the delivery speed is very fast	1
It&apos;s very convenient to travel. It&apos;s very close to the subway. There&apos;s a bar street behind the hotel. The room is not too bad. The quilt is super soft and comfortable!I will live here in the future!	1
Very good. Very clean. It&apos;s newly decorated. Good service. Breakfast is also very good. By the way, the quilt is very thick but very soft. Ha ha, satisfied	1
Mingming&apos;s credit card guarantee. He went to live and said that there was no room left. So he had to upgrade. In the end, the hotel didn&apos;t charge for the upgrade. But it was still very unpleasant. But the hotel was good. The management of Marriott was good	1
It&apos;s a good hotel. Breakfast is good. The room is comfortable. It&apos;s a good reservation. Hotel feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support!We will continue to maintain 5-star catering and service standards, welcome you to stay again, sincerely wish you good health and smooth work!	1
Appearance is very beautiful, keyboard is very beautiful, DDR3 strip, Bluetooth, WiFi all have, perfect screen..	1
I read this book when I grew up.Like the author&apos;s seemingly unreasonable but full of wisdom.When I read that Pipi&apos;s friends dumi and Anika were heartbroken when Pipi left for sailing, they could not help but shed tears.Then when Pipi couldn&apos;t bear to be so sad for her and decided to stay with her friends, I thought I was as happy as dumy and Anika.The most gratifying thing, of course, is that Pipi always has endless gold coins and efforts.Lin Glen has the ability to make you laugh and cry, and have to admit that he is still like a child.	1
The workmanship of the back part of the battery is not particularly good. It&apos;s slightly loose and has a little gap. If you don&apos;t look carefully, you can&apos;t see it.In addition, I think the white leather inner bladder is a little bigger. The surface leather is good, and there are only two thin sponge boards in it. It looks very Shanzhai inside.The battery is a little protruding, of course, at the bottom.	0
It&apos;s very cost-effective and beautiful in appearance.BIOS changed IDE, XP installed soon installed, good.	1
1The appearance is very cool and commercial. I like this simple feeling.2. The keyboard feels good.3. Good heat dissipation, wrist position is not very hot, the fan did not turn.	1
The room was very old and poor. Later, I changed the hotel, which was less than 3-star standard.Hotel feedback July 22, 2008: please put forward specific aspects!We will try our best to improve and correct!thank you!	0
I stayed in the best hotel in Shanghai for a few days. It&apos;s four-star, and I feel the best quality. The reservation desk is for room 2715 at the corner. It&apos;s very comfortable, and my son has a good time. But the hotel staff are indifferent, and they treat foreign guests differently. They also stop taxis. The doorman says to me, please let our guests, I look back, they are a pair of foreigners,I&apos;m not a guest when I stay in this hotel. I let you out of politeness, but I feel very uncomfortable. I hope the price of Ctrip will be lower,	1
There are a lot of comments about the benefits of this book, but when I showed my son, the three-year-old&apos;s reaction was beyond my expectation. From the beginning, he didn&apos;t want to touch it. When he went to bed at night, he also appointed me to take it away. He said, mom, I don&apos;t like that child. You see, his teeth seem to bite! --- I really didn&apos;t expect the result to be like this!	0
This hotel is one of the worst four-star hotels in China that I have ever stayed in. The service attitude and quality are very poor. The room is very small, and there is no meat for breakfast. When it ends at 9:00 and arrives at 8:00, there is basically no food to eat, and the waiters don&apos;t add it!Maybe it&apos;s because of the problems of tourist attractions, but we have stayed in other three-star hotels nearby, which are better than this one in all aspects, and the price can be more than 100 cheaper. I suggest you never stay!There is a public security bureau working in the hotel, so most of them are customers of the Public Security Bureau, so the service to ordinary people is very poor, the sound insulation design of the walls is very poor, so it seems very noisy very early, and there is no way to rest at all!	0
"Mr. Zhang Jingsheng&apos;s concept of love is the first of its kind in China. It&apos;s not easy to roam freely in the sea of love!Mr. Zhang&apos;s idea of love is based on women&apos;s independence and gender equality. How lovely are the independent and free women who bravely pursue love in Mr. Zhang&apos;s life!Although this book was written half a century ago, its ideas are still avant-garde in today&apos;s China, giving people a lot of thinking and enlightenment.The beautiful language in the book is like the babbling water, giving people the enjoyment of beauty.It&apos;s a ""beautiful ramble""!"	1
If only there were a camera, it would be a disappointment if the grinding tool was turned on but not installed.I prefer more than 50-80 can be used as an option.	0
There&apos;s a gap in the side of the screen.The system partition is too unreasonable.Why didn&apos;t you close a backup?	0
Before I saw that everyone said it was very good, so I was very excited. After I bought this book, I saw it was very general. It said a lot, that is to say that we are laymen. It said a lot, that is to say, the importance of money is not enough. Is it not enough to be vulgar? Is it not enough to worship money? There is no need for her to say that I know the importance of money. It is estimated that everyone knows the article about having a princess&apos;s handAlthough it sounds reasonable, if everyone takes good care of their hands and doesn&apos;t do anything, it&apos;s not in line with our actual situation. It&apos;s impossible for everyone to ask a nanny to do it! And although the whole book has more than 200 pages, in fact, the space between the fields is very large and the pages are blank. It&apos;s not worth buying	0
It&apos;s cost-effective. I&apos;ve upgraded to 4G memory, installed information disk and ramdisk, which is very good and powerful.Good keyboard, good touch.	1
Hotel staff service is good, the location is superior, breakfast is also very good.However, the internal facilities of the hotel rooms are relatively old, and the house area is also small. Compared with the newly-built economy hotel, the advantage is not big, which does not reflect the four-star level.At present, demolition construction is being carried out in the surrounding areas, and there are construction conditions downstairs at night. Fortunately, I didn&apos;t hear the sound of construction inside the house.Generally speaking, the cost performance is average.	1
After reading, I don&apos;t know what the author wants to say. I want to know the specific method, but I get nothing and can&apos;t solve the practical problem.	0
I placed an order, but this book was not sent to me. It&apos;s strange that other books were sent to me.I didn&apos;t say why	0
The room is not too small, the bed is good, although not too soft, but also very comfortable, clean.The biggest problem is that the Internet is too expensive. Hkd70 / hour is like stealing money. Why don&apos;t hotels in Hong Kong have free internet access?	1
Keep looking, start to learn to detect, now life and feelings are very good	1
"The hotel facilities have been in use for at least ten years, and the maintenance is poor. When you enter the room, a musty smell comes to your nose, and the carpet is stained. The wooden wardrobe door in the corridor can&apos;t be closed normally, and the musty smell is stronger when you open it. There is a small cabinet door that can&apos;t be closed. When you open it, you find that there are pipes, cobwebs, and thick dust inside.There are still empty beverage bottles left by the guests who stayed last time in the open space between the bed and the console, and there are several hairs on the towel in the bathroomI can&apos;t believe that this is the ""netizen&apos;s high evaluation"" and ""Samsung Hotel"" in the eyes of telephone reservation staff.In the future, if the Internet conditions are inconvenient and I am eager to book a hotel, I will not rashly make the risk move of telephone booking!"	0
The service and distribution speed of Jingdong are not bad. The original unopened ones are satisfied with the machines. The cost performance is very good, and the appearance is also satisfactory	1
"Today, I saw a section of pseudo-random numbers, and suddenly I was enlightened.There has always been a question, how can the random number generated by computer be random? It must be certain. No wonder it is called ""pseudo"" random number.As we know today, it should be vindicated as a ""pseudo"" random number. To be exact, it should be called a one-way random number.I&apos;ve learned a lot!"	1
I used to have a good feeling for Hechun, but I was disappointed after I checked inThe room is very old, everything is very old and looks a little dirty, but also some flavor, the price for Ctrip is too expensive, not worth it!In the future, consider two new Star River holidays, Baihui or new international holiday hotel.	0
"It&apos;s naive. There&apos;s nothing in the whole book except ""David, no way."".It doesn&apos;t help children and parents at all. It&apos;s a waste of money"	0
The location of the hotel is good, the facilities are complete, the price is high, the parking is inconvenient and the charge is high.	1
It looks good and has no bright spots. The numeric keyboard is very convenient for people like me who depend on numbers to eat	1
This book is based entirely on the commercial book published after the film became popular.The content is very incomplete.It collects many of Zhang&apos;s novels, but they are all simplified.	0
22When I arrived in Hong Kong, I thought the address of the hotel was quite good, but I didn&apos;t expect to be very disappointed. At that time, when I made a reservation with Ctrip, I said that I didn&apos;t want a low floor and a big bed room, but when I arrived at the front desk, I was told that I didn&apos;t receive these requests. I finally changed a big bed room, which was also on the third floor. The window looked like a platform, which was very depressing. The bathroom had a very bad smell, and the TV was very comfortableThe service is not very good. Anyway, I feel cheated....	1
I think the touch panel is a chicken rib. In fact, the pressure cap is perfect. The touch screen is useless and not easy to use	0
The room facilities are old, the sofa is about 1950s, and the bathroom is very small.There are many kinds of breakfast, the revolving restaurant is good, and the transportation is convenient.	1
This book was bought for my colleagues. When it came to the book, I also looked through it.The picture of the book is colorful, and some details are drawn in detail, such as the mouth of Kingfisher.According to colleagues, some small regrets are: as a parent-child reading, the text part is not interesting enough, for the three-year-old baby, there are many places that need to be explained separately.Therefore, this set of books is suitable for older babies.Of course, if your baby is interested in plants and animals, and has a preliminary understanding of this information, then this set of books is the best.I appreciate the pictures in the book very much, delicate and vivid.	1
If you have a ThinkPad mouse, why not send one.Today, when I went to Guangzhou zitidian, I almost slapped one of the front desk mm.Pull a face, talk very impatient, as if everyone owes her money, quality is really too bad!Seriously insulted the image of Jingdong!	0
GL40 motherboard is a reduced configuration version of GM45 ~ with T4200 and DDR3 1066, so it can&apos;t give full play to its proper performance ~ and the network card and wireless network card don&apos;t use Atheros with poor compatibility. So far, after refitting XP, the wireless network card still can&apos;t work normally	0
Beautiful appearance..Exquisite workmanship..The new packing seal is unopened at the time of arrival..The battery can last five or six hours..Suitable for mm..The material of the inner liner is thin..	1
I finally chose to try this hotel in the winter of 2008.I always try new things, and I&apos;m willing to give them a chance, but this time I&apos;ve been cheated too much.The Achilles&apos; heel of this apartment hotel are listed as follows: 1. Air conditioning is a mess.Low power and high noise.It&apos;s on, no matter what, and it&apos;s so noisy that you can&apos;t be quiet; when it&apos;s off, it&apos;s so cold that you can breathe out in the room on the 27th floor.2. Not every room has a washing machine.It&apos;s a bit of a fake propaganda.3. The water heater is hot and cold because of the water pressure.You&apos;re lucky not to freeze to death.4. There is no heating in the bathroom. If the hot water is not strong enough, you will definitely catch a cold.5. The balcony is sealed. I won&apos;t let you in.6. The Internet is as fast as a tortoise.Generally speaking, this hotel is OK in the season when it doesn&apos;t need air conditioning and hot water, but it&apos;s free in other seasons.399 a night apartment, a month is 12000, this price in Shanghai can rent what house???It is suggested that the residents should consider it clearly.	0
This book may be written in a foreign format. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s attractive enough. It&apos;s not as interesting as the children&apos;s books in China. It doesn&apos;t adapt to China&apos;s national conditions.	0
It&apos;s a very good hotel. Although it&apos;s not in the center of the city, it&apos;s not far from the bell tower and the drum tower. The starting taxi price is OK, or you can take bus No.606, and the station is just opposite the hotel.The hotel environment is very good, the room is very clean, and the staff service is also quite good.	1
"For the sake of convenient transportation, we chose the mayor building.I thought the mayor&apos;s building was a relatively new hotel, but I was disappointed as soon as I entered the building - the lobby was super small (it should be said that there was no lobby, the appearance of the building was pretty good, but the interior was very bad).The carpet in the room is old.What&apos;s more, when I made a reservation on Ctrip, I saw that there was breakfast for two in the superior suite.But when I checked in, the front desk only gave me a breakfast coupon because I was the only one with my certificate at that time.When I raised a question, the front desk replied, ""you have to register two people&apos;s certificates to give two breakfast tickets."".I said that I have stayed in many hotels in China and have never heard of such unreasonable demands.And the reservation that carries Cheng explains also did not indicate such regulation.The front desk lady replied to me, ""this is the rule of our hotel."".It&apos;s disgusting!Bad impression, I will not consider staying in this hotel next time!"	0
I spent more than 2 weeks, the biggest feeling is that it takes a long time to watch the film.Commonly used software OK, as for the game or desktop is better, don&apos;t expect it to help you.	1
"After reading Mr. Wu Si&apos;s ""hidden rules"" and ""law of blood reward"", there is a tool to understand Chinese history. Some historical facts that could not be understood before can be easily solved, and we can reflect on today&apos;s history.We have benefited a lot.When I just got it, I found that it was different from the previous version of ""hidden rules"". The former was from Fudan University, while the latter was from Chinese publishing house.Looking at the different layout on the bookcase some regret.But later, I found that the Chinese version was better than that of Fudan University, and the layout and illustrations in the book were more natural.Friends who like Mr. Wu, don&apos;t miss it."	1
I don&apos;t remember many words with it!If you want to learn words, there are many ways, there is no need to buy this waste of money, but I regret it!	0
The hotel environment was not good and the atmosphere was not good. My wife and I had just stayed in the hotel when a young lady called to ask if we wanted special services. It was terrible. My wife said that we would not live there any more. Finally, I managed to persuade my wife to stay there all night. But later, it was even more terrible. There was no boiling water in the house, and then we had to boil water by ourselves, but the kettle had grown hairy,Later, a waiter reluctantly changed one, but it was still like this. I didn&apos;t know what to say at that time. Finally, we managed to deal with the mineral water we bought	0
It&apos;s too troublesome to install XP. After reading numerous posts on the Internet, I finally put down a 1g ghost file and made a U disk to install it. But the driver installation is too troublesome, especially the super troublesome sound card driver. The performance of the graphics card is not as good as that of the A card. I can barely make do with playing games	0
A Canadian takes poor Chinese English as an example to show you what is correct English.Not to mention that you can&apos;t learn a few words and accurate expressions in this way, the author&apos;s sarcastic attitude is also unacceptable: Yes, you are native English, so what?The price and content are not equal, not worth it.	0
Because the office needs to be renovated, I live in this hotel. How about this so-called four-star hotel? Now I&apos;ll tell you that it&apos;s better to go to that hotel in Yibin. At night, the chickens are crowing all the time, regardless of their parents. I&apos;ll call until 2 o&apos;clock. I&apos;m on fire late. The front desk will tell the woman the man&apos;s room, and you&apos;re welcome in the eveningDon&apos;t want to sleep well. They complained that they didn&apos;t complain	0
Rui Chenggang just came to our school to give a speech, because some time ago, he held the 19th national book fair in Jinan. He came to Shanda, and I watched his talk on our campus Internet,I feel that he is really a good host. He has been to many countries, met many big scenes and figures of the day, and has unique opinions on many hot issues. He is the youngest visiting scholar of Yale University. A blog article indirectly made Starbucks move out of the Palace Museum. He is really a model for young people to learn from. I recommend this book.	1
As soon as the machine was installed, the hard disk of the system broke down. I went to the store to replace it. The processing speed was quite satisfactory,	0
When I was still in the taxi, the driver began to ask me why I wanted to book this hotel, saying that it was really not so good. I thought it was the driver who wanted to pull me to another hotel to earn some money. Unexpectedly, the car drove all the way through the busy area and came to a remote corner. What I saw was a hotel that looked like a guest house. My first impression was: poor!!Into the hotel, look at its front desk, in Northeast Chinese Description: poor!!It&apos;s a real Hostel, not to mention three stars, two stars are not really!!!What&apos;s more, it&apos;s said on the Internet that there is free broadband. When I ask, not every room has it, and it happens that the room I want to book doesn&apos;t have it....It&apos;s depressing..The next day, to plug board, take a very small, can&apos;t use, I asked the front desk to help me to buy another one, the money I own out, people reply: now can&apos;t buy, I can&apos;t access the Internet, can&apos;t reply to the mail, may suddenly lose more than 100000!!	0
Personally, I don&apos;t think the heat dissipation is very good. I feel some hands are warm, not as good as my ASUS A8. In addition, the keyboard is a little hard, the spacing is a little lower, and I&apos;m not used to typing.There are not many additional software such as power management.	0
I recommend this book to my friend ~ ~ my friend took a look at the cover of the book and said: it&apos;s a book for idealists ~ I said, although it&apos;s idealistic ~ it looks very comfortable ~ I begin to understand the real life from heaven, because I don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening now, what will become later ~ because I believe that things in the world are connected ~ you and me, I and themPast, present, futureI love this book ~ to start to know everything around me again.Pay attention to everyone passing by~	1
It&apos;s very clear on the invoice that there is a free package. After the telephone customer service is finished, there&apos;s no message. Jingdong online customer service has come to us and there&apos;s no package because of the 618 discount. I think it&apos;s very unreasonable. Since there&apos;s no free package, don&apos;t write it. Originally, the price is 400 yuan, but there are a lot of free gifts. Now there&apos;s nothing to do, so I have to buy my own bag	0
After my friends borrowed this book from me, they entrusted me to order another set for them by mail. It can be seen that this book is really good!!	1
When I bought this book, I had not finished reading Eileen Chang and her books.Just because it seems good to read the comments here.Also because eager to know all about Zhang Ailing.After reading Eileen Chang and her works.I&apos;m not in the mood or interested in reading this rubbish book.Calm down!Calm down!Now that you&apos;ve bought it, let&apos;s have a look. It&apos;s better to understand it from another side.But, just saw a section, do not want to see down, so lost in a corner, no longer want to touch.He is said to be a talented man, but I think his writing is really poor.Garrulous, messy, vulgar, speechless!Put all the words in his pig&apos;s mind together to become the so-called gorgeous sentences.General evaluation: garbage	0
European style simple decoration, with bay windows, but all around the building, the big bed is made up of two small beds, you can see that the small bed is very small, duvet, pillow, in the happy valley residential area, relatively quiet, surrounded by supermarkets, laundries, restaurants in general, it is not easy to take a taxi, there is a free bus to Times Square and other places, there is a fee airport shuttle bus	1
Originally, I didn&apos;t want to say that, but Dangdang&apos;s service is really poor. This book shows that the delivery time is 21:58:23 on October 30, 2007, but today is November 12, but I haven&apos;t received it yet. The payment method I chose is express delivery on delivery. After such a long time, ordinary mail has arrived. What kind of express delivery is that? It takes 12 days. The most ironic thing is that I wrote a complaint letter,KF&apos;s reply is to ask me to continue to wait. What&apos;s ahead of KF&apos;s reply is an email asking me to write some comments on this book. I&apos;m so angry that I haven&apos;t received the book. What&apos;s the comment?!!! dangdangdang&apos;s service is really super bad. After that, I don&apos;t sign for it. Other websites have already called or sent an email to inquire about it. Dangdangdang has nothing. Send one in 12 days,Maybe I hate the normal, otherwise how can I ignore the long delivery time?	0
I have stayed in all the five-star hotels in Nanjing, and I choose this one (once shangri la). No matter the hardware facilities or service, they are impeccable... If we say the disadvantage is that the house price is very expensive, ha ha, I hope Ctrip can talk about a more favorable house price	1
Perfect screen, open does not feel thick, very lightweight, keyboard feel good, clear camera!Toshiba DVD, Western Digital hard disk, 45nm processor is good, the temperature is always around 40 degrees, the battery used for 2.7 hours (only on the Internet), no one will play games in the small book, this XP is enough!	1
"At the beginning, I like this book very much, probably because I especially like the cartoon ""the sky is the red river bank"", so I have been looking forward to the ending. Now the ending is finally complete. Love is really a mysterious thing. Every girl will unconsciously imagine when she is reading. If only the woman in the book is me!Even now that I&apos;m not young, I always have this idea. It&apos;s really strange. When I read every book, I think I&apos;m still very young. I think many girls should have this feeling!"	1
Recalling the past always makes people quiet, thinking at the same time, but it is so comfortable, thinking about how many years ago, recalling how many years ago the scene, suddenly feel that they have passed so many years, it is true that in this materialistic age, few can find such quiet words, just narrative, less a lot of false comments, less a lot of expertiseFamily kiss, less a lot of impetuous fame and wealth, more is to bring some simple happiness, simple let us do not need to quarrel with others, do not need to compete with others, originally, flat light is true!	1
Dangdang&apos;s service is still very up to standard. One page of the book I bought was broken and returned to me yesterday afternoon. Thank you Dangdang.	1
To enter the built-in Bois setup installation disk for CD-ROM installation, select the disk, this notebook is only suitable for DIY and people with knowledge of computer.It took three hours to build XP	0
They said they would deliver the fruit tray. When they arrived at the room, they didn&apos;t have it at all. They called and asked several times. At first, they said they would deliver it immediately. Later, they said they would deliver it the next day after work. Moreover, the fruit was whole and didn&apos;t cut.But overall, it&apos;s worth it.	1
Reasonable price, balanced configuration, processor, motherboard chip, graphics card are a new generation.The appearance of side a is OK.In addition, I feel very light (maybe it&apos;s because I use Xiaohei all day), and it&apos;s easy to carry.With drive disk, you don&apos;t need to spend time online.	1
The appearance is atmospheric, beautiful, good heat dissipation, low noise, especially with the keyboard is very convenient for cost personnel.The speed and performance are very good.The built-in vista system is very good. It&apos;s better to master the method than XP.	1
I like mingxiaoxi&apos;s works again and return to the dream world.It feels good.I loved Ming Xiaoxi&apos;s works in high school.Especially the crystal like transparent series, it&apos;s super feel after watching.When I was freshman, I had a summer bubble in my dorm.I thought my classmates didn&apos;t know, but the result was unexpected: everyone spoke very hard.It&apos;s not just love.The characters can be reflected in their own lives.Love in it;	1
Although the facilities are a little old, the good service is warm. The location and environment of the hotel are excellent. For the older individual tourists, it is a better choice to stay in the hotel	1
It&apos;s a very old five-star. Objectively speaking, it may have been worthy of this title, but now it&apos;s really a bit out of date. We strongly suggest that we redecorate and replace new facilities, but the service is still very good. When we learned that we were not satisfied, the manager took the initiative to upgrade our room... The service is very good	1
It&apos;s old, it&apos;s broken, it&apos;s poor, it&apos;s expensive, it won&apos;t live in the future.I also need credit card guarantee for booking. I&apos;m afraid that others will change their mind when they see the scene. It&apos;s disgusting.There&apos;s no front desk. It&apos;s bad	0
It&apos;s the piano paint collection fingerprint function is a bit powerful, ha ha, but it&apos;s nothing. I think it can be ignored completely, so it&apos;s regarded as a graffiti work	0
Since last year, I have been staying in this hotel in Guangzhou. At first, I feel that it&apos;s not bad. The location is good, and it&apos;s convenient to eat and live. The disadvantage is that the bathroom is too small. Later, it gets worse and worse. This time in December, I&apos;m particularly unhappy. When I sleep at night, the guests in the next room are taking a bath, and the water is loud, which sounds like the decoration next door. The service attitude of the hotel restaurant is very poor, maybe we took the breakfast coupon from the hotelThe minister&apos;s face looked as if he owed her money. He ordered the most common sausage. After waiting for half an hour, he didn&apos;t eat and left. The front desk didn&apos;t have a good attitude. I didn&apos;t see a smile from the beginning to the end. I won&apos;t live here next time.	0
Last Sunday, I received a phone call from my mother, saying that I had read the book almost. I carried out several operations according to the methods in the book, and found that the postprandial blood glucose had improved significantly.After reading the book, the first week after practice, the measurement is 6:00, the second week after practice 4 times, postprandial blood glucose dropped to 4:00, has tended to the level of normal people.Dad is also very happy, said that this is my mother had diabetes for more than three years, postprandial blood glucose test the best time!I hope this book can play a certain role in my mother&apos;s illness!I hope this book is a true Gospel for diabetics!	1
The hotel is pretty good, the price is affordable, the service is also in place, recommend it!	1
The performance is very good. I divided it into five areas when I came back. Enjoy it slowly. It&apos;s cool to have a green liner with white color. Generally speaking, it&apos;s good. The battery time is very long. I like it best	1
The room wasn&apos;t clean (there was a dirty sock under the table), the equipment was old, the breakfast was too bad, and there was no cold water in the middle of the bath, almost scalded. Generally speaking, it was poor, so I would not choose to stay in the hotel in the future	0
Baby bought this set of books when he was one year old and two months old. He likes it very much, because the content of the book is simple and easy to understand. The most important thing is that almost every page has a place for the baby to turn and fold, a small toilet cover, colorful bubbles, and a rich refrigerator... To stimulate the baby&apos;s desire to explore, which is worth recommending!It should be noted that it is better for adults to speak to their babies with books, guide and encourage their babies to turn over the active parts of the books, and don&apos;t let them turn over the books freely, otherwise they are easy to tear down the active parts of the books.	1
The battery doesn&apos;t work. After three consecutive charges for 12 hours, the battery can only last for 1 hour and 40 minutes.When the remaining battery power is 99%, it shows that the battery is still available for 1 hour and 59 minutes, and the actual use time is 1 hour and 40 minutes.	0
After reading one third of them, I couldn&apos;t see any more. I bought one.It&apos;s not worth it.Here&apos;s a piece of advice: buy one first, go back and have a look, and then buy the rest.	0
Rubbish, quite rubbish. Many of 1 and 2 are repeated. I don&apos;t say, I always buy the key points. For the details of this, I see the number of pages in the second book, and for the contents, I see the place in the first book. There are so many such things. The overall feeling is that you can buy his book in disguise. The skill is quite cheap. Moreover, the words are big and the lines are sparse	0
It&apos;s more than 80 more expensive than new O ~ ~ 100 more expensive than Yixun ~ ~ ~ but I trust Jingdong ~ ~ ~ and I still have self-service in Tianjin ~ ~ it&apos;s not good to be 100 more expensive~~	0
I bought two copies, ready to give them to someone with a super large nerve bar, to stimulate her!	1
Average speed.And it should be suitable for young people, because the font is relatively small.I can&apos;t see it clearly if I use it for Dad.	0
To tell you the truth, this hotel is really not good. 428&apos;s suite is just a big bed and a small bed, plus a table. There is no bathtub. Hot water takes several minutes to come out. The most embarrassing thing is breakfast. Breakfast is two steamed buns, a little noodles and a bowl of porridge. I can&apos;t figure out why it&apos;s so expensive?I take photos of breakfast and keep them on file. If you want, you can make a field trip!What double early, fool people!	0
There is a bad point on the screen, but it has little effect; the battery is not disabled, that is more than an hour; the heat dissipation is OK, and the lower right side of the keyboard is a little hot.	0
The hotel&apos;s room type is relatively limited, but the business standard room is still good, and the facilities and services are still in place. However, this time, the room is the most edge room. The temperature of the room is relatively low, the heat preservation is poor, the self-service breakfast and lunch taste is OK, and the price is moderate. What this hotel does not lack is that although the location is remote and there are few taxis, it goes to the development zoneIt&apos;s the most convenient thing.	1
Dangdang&apos;s online name does not match the reality, and the order has not been delivered for many days. If you ask customer service, you will only push back and ask the user to place an order again.Such service can&apos;t keep customers.It&apos;s better to go to other websites to buy books.	0
Sent a root connection to the TV wiring, but there is no interface on the book, I do not know why!!!!!!!!When I delivered the goods, I chose Yuantong express. As a result, it was sent by Zhongtong express. It took two trips from Beijing to Zhengzhou before it was delivered.Let me wait for the heart burning, that, received the book or quite excited.	0
This is the worst 4-star hotel I&apos;ve ever stayed in. The hotel was originally 3-star, but after decoration, it is 3-star in essence. You can see the details of bed, faucet, room furniture, carpet and so on.The most hateful thing is that I had a drink with my friends on the night of July 12, and it was more than 3 o&apos;clock when I got back to the hotel. I ordered a ticket in Ctrip and asked to send it to the hotel early tomorrow. It was less than 10 o&apos;clock in the morning, but the guard didn&apos;t give it. He said that the hotel only let their security guard deliver it. Others refused to come to the door and asked me to go down and get the ticket myself. I had a bad headache and asked them to help and help meHe made several phone calls later, but never solved them.Finally, I had to complain to their assistant manager: there are still young ladies going around the hotel at 2-3 PM, and no one is in charge of them. When people deliver tickets for guests, your dog will be in charge of them. What kind of hotel.Later I learned that the dog at the door wanted to ask for a tip.When I left, the front desk staff had a bad attitude.When I got to the door, the dog came and asked me to take the hotel car to the airport. From 150 yuan to 80 yuan, I told him that I would take other people&apos;s car, but I would not take the one you introduced...	0
The piano paint on the cover of the machine is a real failure. You can&apos;t touch it with your hand. You can&apos;t touch it with your hand.What a sweat!!^_And there are too few gifts!	0
1.Delivery is slow, order No.19, payment No.20, delivery No.2 on No.28.If you don&apos;t fill in or seal the joint insurance form, it&apos;s useless. 3.There is no Chinese manual, there are two pieces of paper, there are all kinds of words, but there is no sign of MSI, 4.There is not a phone that can be made directly. There is a voice call that can be made 10 times.Ten times doesn&apos;t work.Waste consumer money 5.The battery is not original, I suspect it is parallel	1
"For apartment hotels, the expectation is not too high, but it&apos;s OK.Unfortunately, after entering Nanyou, I was extremely disappointed. The room is big enough, but the decoration is old-fashioned and of low quality (I live in a luxury two person suite). I don&apos;t recommend this hotel!!The funniest thing is the ""package ticket"". I paid 60 yuan more for a few rounds of bowling. When I checked in, I gave me those bowling coupons. The funniest thing is that these ""coupons"" can&apos;t be used on Fridays, Saturdays and daysThe office didn&apos;t remind me. It paid 60 yuan more for nothing. Although it wasn&apos;t much, the point was that my girlfriend and I were very angry. Do you want to go to Zhuhai to ""bowling"" on weekdays?I still have those coupons. I&apos;d like to see Nanyou and ShenzhenCtrip.comWhat&apos;s the explanation!!!Hotel feedback September 7, 2007: once again, I would like to express my deep apology to you.The hotel sports package includes breakfast coupon, golf coupon or bowling coupon, which can be used on weekdays and holidays.Due to a new employee who was not familiar with the business on the day of the bowling alley incident, he thought that you were using other coupons that could not be used on the weekend, which caused misunderstanding. We also failed to understand your unhappiness in time. Afterwards, we specially reviewed this case to ensure that similar incidents will not happen again.To express the sincere apology of the hotel.Your bowling ticket can be reissued at any time. The hotel provides a free deluxe suite for two and promises to provide you with high quality and considerate service.I hope you can give us one"	0
The room is small and old.When I went to the lobby to renew my room at 12 pm, I saw a rat passing through the hall	0
When booking, it is indicated that the room on the second floor is needed. When checking in, it is on the first floor. It is said on the Internet that 10 yuan is added to a breakfast, but 15 yuan is actually charged.You have to pay 10 yuan for parking in the hotel.The carpet in the deluxe single room was so wet that I was speechless.But the hotel environment is good, but it&apos;s a pity that the environment is not good enough	0
The first time is too laggy, and the default is too much. You must optimize it yourself, otherwise it will be too stuck.	0
Beautiful appearance, balanced configuration, rich interfaces, high value.The heat dissipation is not bad. It won&apos;t be too hot.There are cameras and microphones for direct video chat; there are card readers, and they are compatible with XD cards.	1
The bag in Beijing is good, and the contents of the bag are much worse than those of the last time. The cleaning is direct. In my heart, the good part is bad. The system is slow. The rest is what I want to do. I can think about going back. I don&apos;t know some consumer needs	0
22The deluxe suite of Jiangjing on the 7th floor, which was reserved on the 7th floor, only knew after checking in that Jiangjing needed to open the door and go to the public balcony through the stairway to see the Jiangjing. The most abominable thing is that the bed in the bedroom was separated from the public passage by only one glass window (with curtain), so it was not easy to see the Jiangjing, and the voice of passers-by was very clear.When she went to the front desk and asked for a room change, the young lady said that she had no choice but to check out. The young lady said that there was one room on the sixth floor, but it was a standard room on the sixth floor. She also asked to check out. The young lady said that there was one room on the fifth floor, and then she went up to the fifth floor. This time, it&apos;s really a spacious and comfortable Riverview suite, so she can check in directly.When I took a bath, I found that the shower room was very small, and it was hard to turn around. Moreover, the water was cold and hot, so I had no choice but to endure the whole night and check out in the morning.It&apos;s a four-star hotel, not even two.	0
"I read this book because of its title. I got up very well and expressed my heart.Love, like never hurt!The author of maybe is Aries, and I am both. When I read this book, I really feel like I am the heroine of this book, because they all have the personality of Aries.The dialogue in the book is very interesting, I like it very much, especially the sentence ""giving up doesn&apos;t mean that you don&apos;t love, it&apos;s because of love that you give each other the opportunity to choose.""If only I could understand it then"	1
The memory should be upgraded to 2G. In addition, the price will be reduced by 300 ocean after purchase.It&apos;s depressing.The driver is easy to find, but asus&apos;s customer service is not very satisfied. Tell him that the sound of the speaker is too small, what does he mean that it doesn&apos;t affect the use!I&apos;m so depressed!	0
Review Sanmao, let me more like her forthright and sincere love.Sanmao left our sight, but people who like her will not forget her.All the moving faintly reverberated in my mind.This kind of breath is very difficult to capture in the present work.Perhaps, because the world has become so illusory, people who like the real Miss Sanmao more.	1

The history of Chinese Fine Arts (July 2008, Sanlian bookstore) written by Jiang Xun, a Taiwan scholar, is a popular book. The author can turn the complicated history of fine arts into simple and beautiful prose, and the academic nature is integrated into the readability. It is not too good to call it a book for everyone.It is difficult to write such a book without certain academic ability.I&apos;m a weak scholar. It&apos;s always obscure when it comes to Chinese aesthetics. So when I saw this beautifully printed atlas in the bookstore, I decided to buy it.After reading it, I recommended it to many young students.	1

After 20 minutes of starting up, the touch pad can burn your fingers. Carefully check that the fan doesn&apos;t work. Blow hard, it turns again, and it doesn&apos;t work again.Through a few days of observation, the fan turns and doesn&apos;t turn, it&apos;s a double day of ice and fire	1
Battery life standard 2-5 hours, only 1 hour 40 minutes during the video period, I do not know why?	0
Shishuo Xinyu has not been seen for a long time. From the initial appreciation to the attentive study, and then to the cooling of enthusiasm, Shishuo witnessed my whole career as a student.But he is good at learning, but his learning is going from bad to worse.The daily price is not as hungry as it used to be. I bought a lot of books, but most of them were placed in high-rise buildings. I have little leisure to read them. When I look back, I can&apos;t help sighing about the accumulation of dust.If you don&apos;t read a volume of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, you can borrow a cup of wine from someone else to eliminate the block in your heart.	1
Very beautiful, super value choice, Intel&apos;s SSD is not really covered, very satisfied with the actual measurement!	1
