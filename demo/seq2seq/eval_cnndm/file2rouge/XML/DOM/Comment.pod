=head1 NAME

XML::DOM::Comment - An XML comment in XML::DOM

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::DOM::Comment extends L<XML::DOM::CharacterData> which extends 
L<XML::DOM::Node>.

This node represents the content of a comment, i.e., all the characters
between the starting '<!--' and ending '-->'. Note that this is the
definition of a comment in XML, and, in practice, HTML, although some
HTML tools may implement the full SGML comment structure.
