=head1 NAME

XML::DOM::EntityReference - An XML ENTITY reference in XML::DOM

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::DOM::EntityReference extends L<XML::DOM::Node>.

EntityReference objects may be inserted into the structure model when
an entity reference is in the source document, or when the user wishes
to insert an entity reference. Note that character references and
references to predefined entities are considered to be expanded by the
HTML or XML processor so that characters are represented by their
Unicode equivalent rather than by an entity reference. Moreover, the
XML processor may completely expand references to entities while
building the structure model, instead of providing EntityReference
objects. If it does provide such objects, then for a given
EntityReference node, it may be that there is no Entity node
representing the referenced entity; but if such an Entity exists, then
the child list of the EntityReference node is the same as that of the
Entity node. As with the Entity node, all descendants of the
EntityReference are readonly.

The resolution of the children of the EntityReference (the replacement
value of the referenced Entity) may be lazily evaluated; actions by the
user (such as calling the childNodes method on the EntityReference
node) are assumed to trigger the evaluation.
